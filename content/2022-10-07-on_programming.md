Software developers are authors of their own death.
And in that, they are similar to doctors.
We actively try to make software that abstracts away what we are paid to do. 


```rust 
// in rust:
trait  
pub struct Programmer;

trait SelfDestroyer {
    fn make_one_self_obsolete();
}

impl SelfDestroyer for Programmer {
    fn make_one_self_obsolete() {}
}

```


I joined this collective effort last year.
