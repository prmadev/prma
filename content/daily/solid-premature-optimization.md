Honestly, the primary challenge I encountered with complex codebases originated from adhering to {{<abbr `SOLID`>}} principles. Surprisingly, they appeared to turn the straightforward task of making any changes into a Herculean feat. Introducing numerous cumbersome abstractions also took a toll on performance.

Talk about actual premature optimizations!

I much prefer something like {{<abbr `CUPID`>}} principles. [More information on CUPID](https://cupid.dev/)
