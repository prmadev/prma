The problems surrounding {{< lang `Python` >}} programs on NixOS seem never-ending.
I often have to refrain from installing most {{< lang `Python` >}} programs.
On each update, another one of them breaks during installation â€“ either their tests don't pass, or their dependencies fail in some way.

And to be honest, I give the benefit of the doubt to NixOS, seeing its result with other languages, and knowing what I know about pip.
