Honestly, I cannot say that diversity quotas are _radical_ feminism; or in any terms extreme. Especially since they are implemented in societies that have endured thousands of years of cultural, institutional, and governmental oppression of women and minorities, which, we have yet to witness significant progress in achieving true equality for these oppressed groups.

Equal opportunity does not entail placing the food on top of the trees and then asserting that the whale just didn't take it while the chimp did.
