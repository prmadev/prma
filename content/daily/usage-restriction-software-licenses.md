Please think twice before saying, <q cite="people">usage restriction is good because you might want to prevent someone from using your tool for war, crime, etc.</q>

Like, you know that a poorly enforced license won't deter a person in that situation from using your software, right?

There are probably better arguments for including usage restrictions in a software license; this one is a terrible one.
