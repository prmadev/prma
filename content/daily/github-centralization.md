I find the situation around GitHub centralization distressing.
And this extreme relience on GitHub is worrying.
Maybe in time things change.
But the moment I find a job and thus don't need to keep my repos on GitHub anymore, I would like to move to a more federated forge.
Codeberg seems like the closest option.
I will just simply mirror my commits to GitHub for the time being, slowly retiring them when I'm sure that codeberg remotes have the necessary configurations and flows that are needed.
I don't think i can retire my account though. Every place I worked or want to work, are using GitHub.
I cannot but worry about the same amount of enshitification that twitter and reddit has taken, to also come for GitHub.
