In the good old days,
I loved the internet,
I loved how it was filled with people like me,
or at least people that I looked up to. 
But not just people, rather the mediums that we used to communicate through seemed more social.
More done by the word of the mouth.
I used to search the internet for the words that was interesting to my-teenage-self,
and google would give me a handful of blogs by people like me. 
I used to go to twitter, friend-feed,
facebook or orkut or any other one of numerous social platforms and spend sometime,
escaping the harsh realities of being ostracized by my parents, my teachers and my peers at school. 
I loved the internet in those days. Even though I was not as popular as others in the same social circles,
I used to enjoy talking in the crowd of the amazing, people that I admired.


In time, many of the places that I loved got closed, and many others transformed into beasts that became tools of ostrocization.
Even though I was not the subject of these mistreatment, I could recognize the environment that amplified bullies.
The search engines were no better.
Every day, more than the day before the number of hyper-SEO-ized generated bullshits and tech-shit-site-as-businesses,
conquered more and more of the slots that was previously reserved for passionate few with independent blogs.    

I grow to accept the comforatable fascination of those days as artifact of the lost innocense of earlier internet,
and my faulty impression of what actually happened.


But that desparation began to shatter after Elon Musk fucked up twitter and lead me to give fosstodon another chance.
And Oh, how I'm glad I have done that.
I found the early days of friendfeed there. The honest circling of information. The actual social web that I so crave for.

That was a fluke. Right? That could not be more than a glitch on the matrix of bullshit humanity made. Right?

Then came the second brick, shattering the whole illusion, kagi.

Kagi is a paid search engine. Out of curiousity I gave it shot.
I could not believe my eyes. A page full of blog posts about "permacomputing" on the first page.
Shortly after that, I have understood that the loveable indie blogging that I thought to be on life-support,
was never gone, but instead lived on, as powerful as before. Only the so called social medias and the search-engines that I used to put my trust on,   
betrayed me.

The illusion was no more.

I decided to make a change.

I'm in process of changing that now. But I have successfully managed to recognize what I want my experience to be now,
I have recognized a few low hanging fruits and I taken steps to secure them for myself. 

Firstly, I liked to have an honest view of the internet, not the just the shiniest objects in there, but ones that actually made internet "made-by-people".  
A search engine. Happily as I have mentioned before, the job was already done. Kagi is the way to go for me.

After that I want a constant stream of thoughtful honest content. An RSS aggregator of some sort. Feedbin was the another one for me.  

Another low-hanging fruit was already done, a social website that was optimized for community, not journalists, mastodon.


Another email service, one which is not invading my privacy, one which is not crawled with spammers. Someone suggested me protonmail. I took the advice. I'm finding it to be alright.

As you may have noticed, out of the four, three are paid services.
And two are closed-sourced.
And one (the email service) is causing a vendor lock in.

I think even though that is not super-ideal, They are the betters of the alternatives. I have set of criterea.
But I notice now that this post has already gone on long enough, an I think those criteras contain ideas that deserve my elaboration. 
So I will live them for another post.


## Dear reader...

For now, I'm loving my experience, I'm already feeling the calm and a refuge when using the internet again. 
And I encourage your dear reader who feels the same frustrations of the earlier me, to reevaluate your usage of the internet.
It can definitely be much nicer than you feel right now.
I know.I'm living it right now.
