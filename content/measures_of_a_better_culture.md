## Incentivising clever people, over smart people

### Making value as the main driver

### What clever people think

#### Smarter
(actually more the victim of Dunning-Kruger effect)

#### Faster
(actually more messy, relying on others to clean up their mess)

#### More creative
(actually ignorant of the contraints of their environment)

### Where the society comes in

#### Clever people are left to make a mess and no checks-and-balance

### "Be a wolf, or end-up a lamb": the chicken-or-egg problem with the parents 

## the absordity of this post

no clever person will even reads this, they are not self-aware.
yet we have to stop incentivising them
