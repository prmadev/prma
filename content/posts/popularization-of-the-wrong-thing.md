## Intro {#intro}

There are people who proudly declare:

> I used to like X, but then it became popular, so I don't like it anymore.

I fucking hate these people. What a bunch of douchebags. Do you consider yourself superior to others?

However, there are circumstances where I believe that this perspective is valid and can be seen as a positive stance to take.

## The Adventurer {#the-adventurer}

There is a group of people who enjoy uncovering unknown valleys, experiencing them, and staying committed until they reach a more popular stage. They relish the thrill of discovery and take pleasure in popularizing things.

One such group is comprised of individuals who embrace emerging programming languages, with {{<lang `Zig`>}} and {{<lang `Nim`>}} serving as good examples. Some of them thrive in the startup scene, where they are comfortable taking risks and making decisions that have a tangible impact. However, in a more stable environment, when things become mainstream, their services are no longer required. Their advocacy and contributions are graciously acknowledged, and they happily move on to the next cutting-edge endeavorâ€”a clean break.

## The Adventurer's Friend

Similar to the first group, there are individuals who relish spending time in less mainstream communities. It's true that you can always find individuals with egotistical tendencies in these non-mainstream groups, as they seek to exert authority over others. However, there are also truly brilliant people who are dedicated to their craft, and they are both driven by their passion and drive the development of their crafts. You might encounter them later on as they become giants in their fields, but at that point they may become too preoccupied to engage with people they don't already know.

These communities are incredibly dynamic and enjoyable. Your actions can influence the trajectory of the entire community's existence.

## The Misunderstood

The reason for this post is that I've recently found myself in this group.

If you delve into any modern art history book, you'll encounter fascinating descriptions of abstract art. Its intended message is simple, in contrast to figurative art, which aims to depict tangible subjects. Abstract art seeks to convey emotions without adhering to reality, much like instrumental music. The history of abstract art is marked by experimentation and truly impressive works, both technically and emotionally.

However, if you search for abstract art on most art trading websites or social media, what you'll discover is a type of decorative art. It experiments with various elements but often lacks novelty. Nevertheless, it can add exceptional charm to your hallway's wall. This is a valid art form that enriches the world. However, for those seeking experimental abstract art that conveys emotions like hatred or sorrow, it's increasingly challenging to find it because the more popular usage of the term 'abstract art' leans toward the decorative.

However, what recently placed me in this group was not the above. Instead, it was a few years ago when I fell in love with a genre of music called {{<abbr `Lo-Fi`>}}. {{<abbr `Lo-Fi`>}} music is a genre with a nostalgic approach to music, incorporating background noises from phonographs, sound clips from old movies, and yet embracing contemporary techniques. Apps like Loffee perfectly capture this kind of music for me.

Unfortunately, over the past couple of years, {{<abbr `Lo-Fi`>}} has been used interchangeably with chill-hop ambient music. Most people use it as background music during their focus sessions, and you might hear it in coffee shops and YouTube videos. The famous Lofi Girl YouTube channel also features music that I can only describe as ambient chill-hop. If you search for {{<abbr `Lo-Fi`>}} music, you'll predominantly find that genre, which saddens me because I spend hours searching for music in my favorite genre, only to encounter ambient music.

## Dear Readers...

The reason for my post is to ask if you are aware of any good sources for the {{<abbr `Lo-Fi`>}} music I'm searching for. If you do, please reach out to me.

If, by chance, I discover a reliable source, I will update this post below this line.
