For a long time, I have been wondering about my guilty pleasures, trying to figure out which pleasure, in particular, I feel guilty about. I think about other people’s answers, looking for things one does not need much practice to enjoy—‘satisfactions of pigs’, as [John Stuart Mill](/person/john_stuart_mill) would have put it. He famously wrote:

> It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.

He argued that the quality of pleasures is much more important than their quantity. Listening to {{<pers `Bach`>}}, even if it brings little joy to someone, would always trump the manic joy of attending a {{<pers `Britney Spears`>}} concert.

However, as it happens, I am not a Millian. I find that argument bogus. I don’t feel any shame about listening to the cheesiest ’80s music and then complimenting that with {{<pers `Mozart`>}}’s Requiem.

Don’t get me wrong. I have a strong sense of guilt. I am a vegan. I help others when I can. And I regularly make life-changing decisions that may not favor my well-being but end up benefiting others. I just have not found many places in my life where guilt and pleasure co-exist.

I figured that my sense of guilt probably sucks every ounce of pleasure from different activities. That theory seemed shaky, at best.


Then, just an hour ago, it hit me. I have been looking in the wrong place. My two guilty pleasures? Fine coffee and fine audio equipment. It might sound quite strange to feel guilty about these. But consider this: My ethical stance in life is firmly rooted in [Hedonistic Utilitarianism](https://www.utilitarianism.com/hedutil.htm), which basically means to do whatever it takes to bring the most amount of pleasure and the least amount of suffering to the world. For example, the pleasure I take in eating meat does not surpass the suffering it brings to the animals from which the meat came.


If I have some amount of money, I should spend it in such a way that it creates the most joy in the world. That surely includes myself, but probably a hungry kid on the street could derive much more pleasure from the same amount of money I am spending on headphones and coffee. For sure, these lavish purchases mostly fall under the mid-range products of a European household. But I live in a third-world country, and even with the salary of a developer, they are still more than most people are willing to pay, here. I am ashamed to admit that I enjoy fine coffees and fine headphones.

It turns out, I am a proud pig and an ashamed Socrates.
