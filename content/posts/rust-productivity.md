I think the best way to characterize <span class="language">Rust</span>'s productivity, is to put it on a quality axis.

If you want low quality code (prototyping, etc) rust is much less productive than the alternative.

For medium level of quality, <span class="language">Rust</span> is similar to others.

For high quality code, <span class="language">Rust</span> is much more productive than any alternatives.

Quality is intentionally vague, to encapsulate performance, leanness, documentation, and security.
