I think the best way to characterize {{<lang `Rust`>}}'s productivity, is to put it on a quality axis.

If you want low quality code (prototyping, etc) rust is much less productive than the alternative.

For medium level of quality, {{<lang `Rust`>}} is similar to others.

For high quality code, {{<lang `Rust`>}} is much more productive than any alternatives.

Quality is intentionally vague, to encapsulate performance, leanness, documentation, and security.
