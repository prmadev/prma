in 1958, Garrett Hardin, started his famous article called "The Tragedy of the Commons" like this: 
> At the end of a thoughtful article on the future of nuclear war, Weisner and York concluded that "Both sides of the arms race are ... confronted by the dillema of steadily increasing military power and steadily decreasing natonal security. It is our considered our professional judgment that this delimma has not professional technical solution. If the great powers continue to look for solutions in the area of science and technology only, the result will be to worsen the situation."

Hardin then continue to shake the world by describing an insurmountable problem, namely the problem of population growth, by explaining that given a common resource, when every actor tries to maximize their gain, they will end up hurting everyone, including themselves. 

The famous analogy goes like this. Imaging a grassland, between three farmers. Each farmer takes their cow to the grassland everyday to graze. So far, so good. But now the cow of one of the farmers end up being pregnent. Our lucky farmer, end up with two cows, doubling his own profit. Other farmers, learning from this pioneers victory, start buying and breading as many cows as possible, increasing their own individual profit, at the sametime as grazing the grassland naked of any greens. At the end, the grass gets extinct, taking the starving cows of the greedy farmers with it. At the end all farmrs end up without any cows, their wealth, worse than before.

He call it the tragedy of the commons. I call it a very great model of what makes software landscape less enjoyable for all the stakeholders: the user, the developer, the ceo, and the investor. 

How meta!

## The Clever One, The Frustrated One and The Scared One 

Here is the typical character, the usual one, the one that most developers embodied. Let's call it, Sarah. Sarah wan't to learn a new technology. Once that could increase her chances of getting a better position than she has, right now. How does she go about it? She start finding a field, and then she looks for a technology, say, a language. Let's call that field something imaginary, so not to anger anyone by accident. How about front-end development? 
For fron-end Sarah finds out a few different contenders in the field. She asks herself, what could the industry be thirsty for? The naive answer she arrives at, is "the most reliable one, the one that is the pleasure to develop and the one that has the most advantages". Oh, Sarah, you impractical idealistic perfectionist, you! 

With those criteria in hand, she chooses Elm language (another fantasy-creature). She goes on to learn Elm. But out of curiousity she takes a curious peak at the linkedin jobs page, and she finds out that there are only three jobs available for it. Befaddelled she wonders if her impression of the language was correct.

She asks Tom, a wonderful CTO she know, if Elm was not all that it was advertised to be. Tom, to Sarah's amazement, confirms her earlier beliefs about Elm. Elm *is* actually a great language, with long-lasting reliability, mature ecosystem, and joyous development experience.
Sarah, confused, even more than before, asks Tom if he is hiring any Elm developers. Tom again, answers with a firm "No! Where would I find the workforce to develop Elm? But we are aggressively hiring javascript ones!" (again another language with a name far enough from any actual real world examples).

Sarah thinks a bit and then exclaims, "What about me?".
Tom shakes his head and says: "oh, no. That won't do. For any application we need 20 people to constantly maintain it and fix bugs, where would we find 20 Elm developers?"
"Well, shouldn't Elm apps need much less maintainence, considering the amount of bugs that are just catched in the development process in the first place?" Sarah retorts, but only in her head. She has an idea, "Oh, so, maintaining a fragile codebase, could mean that the job market is more hungry for new javascript developers, that means job security!".  

Feeling clever, she confirms her suspicioun by looking into (the-imaginary-) yellow-pages called Glassdoor. Lo and behold, an unending page, filled with different javascript job postings.

Well, Sarah learns javascript and all her beliefs gets validated, she becomes a very wealthy engineer, with a great job security, with each company she enters trying to keep her, year-after-yer, while other companies trying to persuade her by higher and higher offers. Or at least that was the boring version of this post that did not start with the word "tragedy". 

Instead she finds out that others, just like her, were *clever*. A lot of other new-comers picked up the language with the most job postings. For any job, there was at least a hundred more competition. The winner, is the one with the most qualifications and lowest price. Or should we call them a winner when the moment they become a bit more ambitious, a new job posting will be added to the list, replacing them quickly with the next one.

The Tom, our CTO, exhausted with on-boarding one low-budget, inexperienced developer after the next one, complains to the CEO. The CEO talks with investors, they too are dissatisfied with their profits being cut by the less than efficent workforce, asking for a solution from the CEO. 
CEO comes back with a plan for changing the technology from javascript to Elm. The investors happy with the plan, take a few days for making a decision. They comeback after a few days with a concern. "Nobody uses Elm! None of our competitions use this language. That's a big we are not willing to make risk!".  

Arash, the CEO, CTO, CFO, and Product Manager and the founder of a new start up, faces the same imaginary challenge of choosing a stack.
Startups being the overly-risky businesses as they are, Arash looks at what bigger companies, like the ones that Tom is the CTO on, are doing, to find out the proven path.

## The Lose-Lose-Lose situation

At every step of the way, each person did the optimize for their profits. They were offered a better alternative, at every step, they agreed with the advantages of the alternative, yet they chose the lesser choice (to make it even less controvertial I will refrain to remind you that the lesser imaginary choice was javascript, ofcourse). And for that, all the individuals are worth off than if all of them agreed to move to the better alternative. Not just individuals, but the whole ecosystem is also hindered by the fragile mountain of abstractions left by the rapidly increasing predecessors.

So why did they all failed to make their own and others better? Was it fault of the technology? Or was it the failure of the ecosystem? 
You are smart enough, to deduce the answer; after all you were smart enough to know what languages I actually meant when I came up with my imaginary languages. 

## The Solution 

I have no idea. The nuclear arsenal is still growing since the years of the coldwar. Yet we are not in coldwar anymore. And gladly, it was not because we ended up being wiped by a nuclear war. Instead it was the combination of mutually assured distruction and the leaders of the two countries realizing the danger of not taking the risk of accepting the alternative that let us in at least a better situation. 

At the sametime, Garrett Hardin's concern, the over-population and the environmental disasters, seem to be an on-going battle. Apparantly, the long-term danger of not taking the alternative, is long enough that it is not even the concern of the same generation, not taking the alternatives, the people that pay it was their grandsons: "Fuck those brats".

In software, everything is on a faster pace, the price is less dire than the previous situations, and people envolved are much more honest than politicians and much smarter than the avarage voter.

Yet, the solution is not some weirdly specific set of ritualistic actions that we should take. It is worse. It is just as Garrett Hardin subtitle his article: 
> The population problem has no technical solution; it requires a fundamental extension of in morality.



# Dear Readers...

I know! The gastly claim of "to improve developer experience we first should grow an ethical sense", seems absurd. 
Yet I see no specifically little amount of gradual change, where at least some one on the whole chain did not bite the bullet and risk it.
