There is inherent value in documenting the tools one employs:
- Documenting your tools encourages you to be more mindful and deliberate in your tool selection.
- Sharing them publicly serves as a reminder to actively utilize and endorse what you recommend to others, embodying the practice of "preaching what you practice."


Naturally, this notion did not emerge from the depths of my own ruminations. Rather, I observed that the immensely more prominent [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/uses) has embraced it.


## Hardware

My laptop, a second-hand `Dell XPS-13 7390`, boasts 8GB of RAM but lacks a dedicated graphics card. I've upgraded its SSD to a capacious 2TB m.2 NVME. My affection for this compact laptop knows no bounds. It exudes efficiency, running on minimal power, and boasts a delightful full-HD monitor. The keyboard, in particular, provides a tactile experience reminiscent of a mechanical one. In terms of navigation, I rely solely on the laptop's trackpad; no external mouse is required.



My phone, a `Redmi Note 10 Pro Max`, leaves me thoroughly dissatisfied. I hold no love for either Android or iOS, as both dictate the software on my hardware, leaving me with no control. I carry a miniature surveillance device in my pocket wherever I roam. Rest assured, I plan to replace it as soon as I stumble upon a viable alternative. Should you possess any suggestions, kindly reach out via email; my address resides at the conclusion of this post.
