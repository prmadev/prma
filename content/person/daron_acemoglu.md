Daron Acemoglu is an economist, who authured _Why Nations Fail_. 
He has a pretty neat theory about why some nations strive, while others hardly can manage.
Have you read or seen Lord of the Rings? Natural resources are like the ring: they give you power, but they also curse your existence. Why? Because natural resources make the power of the authorities, independent from people. [^1]

[^1]: I'm definite that Daron did not put his complex theory in these terms. But I think he would have had much more success communicating them if he did.
