John Stuart Mill was a Utilitarian philosopher.

Although I count myself a utilitarian, I cannot agree with much of his philosophy, since his version of Utilitarianism included a "quality" parameter. Which means that he discounted pleasures and pains of beings, based on their quality. Here is quote from him that should make this position clear:

> It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.

Such a pompous ass!
