Jeremy Bentham is probably [^1] the founder of Utilitarianism [^2].


[^1]: I say probably, mostly to account for the fact that his idea is pretty simple, and probably many have followed and advocated for the idea behind utilitarianism with other names.

[^2]: Utilitarianism proposes that "when given the choice, you should do as such that your actions would result in a world that has the least amount of suffering and the greatest amount of pleasure."
