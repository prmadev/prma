Garrett Hardin was a rather influential and controversial philosopher and ecologist. My main interest is his articulation of a phenomenon, named _The Tragedy of Commons_.

I would like to also emphasize that although I like his paper with the same name on this phenomenon, my interest in him ends there.

Notably, he had a pretty disturbing prescriptive view on immigration policies.
