Web is fucked.
But we any person with some resources at hand and a curiousity at heart and willingness to be intentional with their choice of tools can have nice experience.


## The Reasons

There are some reasons for why web is fucked. I will just mention them by name so we are on the same page. 
- It is bloated
- Full of add
- Features come first, bugfixes if they are cornerd.
- It is optimized for journalists and advertisers. Not you. 
- You are locked in and silod. 
- They don't empower you. 

### A short side-track

The last item may need a little expanding.
Believe it or not, internet is a tool.
it is *something* created to fascilitate *some action*.
Which means that it is there to empower *someone(S)*.

The *Web 2.0* and *Social Media* (the somethings) promised us to be empowering people (the someones) to have better social connections (the some actions).
At first they seemed to somewhat deliver on that promise. For many they had a pleasent experience at the beginning of web 2.0.
In time the incentives of these Social media companies took them to another path, one different from their stated mission. 
Now, the Web 2.0 is there to fascilitate jorunalists and celebrities (the actual someones) to more fame and recognition (the some action).
The incentive for these companies? Money from advertisers. The more engaging, the better.
The dooms day, super political reporter,
The enraging, populist racist politician,
the trolling impulsive ceo and
the stupid drama driven celebrity
are the four horsemen of reactionary engagement.

To sum it up, you have been made for a fool, social media is not to empower you.

## Go Empower yourself

There is a small prerequisite, before you move along:
You should already have overcame your fear of missing out. 
I cannot tell you how.
But I can help you see why your fears are missplaced.
You should ask yourself. Do i really miss out on anything important?
Does the last shitty thing that Donald Trump said, actually made me do anything different with my life?
If so, was twitter (or whatever the fuck that they call it these days) the only or the best platform to hear about it?

To me, even in Iran, where the official channels are the guranteeed ways of hearing lies, twitter is an over kill.
Friends and private messages relay the important things to me anyways.
And sure, they might spend time on twitter, isn't that relay of information the actual promise of social media?
when that need is being fullfilled anyways, what need is there for twitter then?

If you are privilaged enough to live in a country where official channels are ok,
and your life depends on some important information, say hurricane allerts, I'm sure there are services dedicated for just that.
If you enjoy reading articles from news, find out who is the author and follow them directly. Otherwise, you actually don't need this shit.

You are lead to believe so, because these companies, are like an emotionally abusive partner.
They tell you that you are too stupid,
and you cannot manage your life without them.
You have it nice, they say,
and you have all your friends because of them.
They disfigure your interactions, shove ads and bullshit down your trought, and then tell you that they do it because they love you so much. 
And when they fuck up and you standup to them, they make a show of appologies and promises of change, only to hit you back stronger, later on. 

Don't belive them. I know its hard. But leave them. It might be scarry and hard at first. But you will find yourself to have much better life, afterwards.
You deserve more, my friend.

## How to find a good tool

### Step One: Find The Low Hanging Fruits

You are here and ready to change your life.
Will need to recognise the areas of need in your life.
What needs are your trying to satisfy? On which shitty services are you relying right now?
Find the most common denominators and start from there.

For me I needed:
1. a some steady stream of lightweight information.
2. a daily dose of interaction with new nerds like myself.
3. a way to discover specific data.
4. a way to send email.

For each of these I was relient on some shitty means of getting information.
For the first two, I was relient on twitter, instagram and reddit and google news.. 
For the third and the fourth one I used google's services. 
All under-delivered and caused me a lot of stress.
 


### Step Two: Find Effective Replacements

In my earlier post I have mentioned that I already have replaced most of these services with better ones. 
But I have not mentioned what constitutes an effective solution.

Here are some of the criterias and rules of thumbs for an empowering tool:

1. It should not cause you any harm. 
2. It should not lock you in.
3. It should not feel frugal. 

Let me explain: 

#### 1. It should not cause you more harm than good

If the tool cause you more harm than good, why are you using it at all? 

Ensure that the tool is transparent about how it works.
Tools that knowingly hurt you are less incentivized to open up about their inner working.
Open source and audited (if you trust the incentives and capabilities of the auditer) softwares are a good way doing that. 

Make sure the incentives of the creators of the tool are aligned with yours. There are always misalignments in incentives.
But the degree to which that happens are not always the same. The selling or renting of software may incentivize the developers to plan for obsolecense or sell incomplete products or lock you in.
However, that miss-alignment pales in comparison to ad-driven models.

#### 2. It should not lock you in

If the tool you are using, cause you to be locked in, when the incentives of the company starts to change, you are fucked. 
in 2015 I used to be a premium evernote user. I put everything in it.
Then they droped right-to-left support (which is necessary for some languages in middle-east).
They didn't deem the middle east to be a good market, so they just ignored every request.
The pain came when I could not use the exported information from evernote to do anything with it.
That was the lock in. I had to go through a world of pain to manually export my information.

One question that can help you to find out how much something can lock you in, is to ask this question:
"Will it be harder for me to move to a competitor from this service, after I have started using it, than it is now before I started to do so?"
If the service keeps your notes and only gives them back in a non-standard way through xml or json files,
it would be much harder for you to move to a competitor, after your have poured your notes in the first service, than now that you have not. 


 

#### 3. It should not feel frugal.

Remember the point of this exercise. It is to make your life easier.
There are absolutely good reasons and causes that may want to pursue that may need for you to be frugal in someway or the other.  
For me, it was animal rights and the frugality was (funnily enough) veganism.

But that takes energy. And it could isolate you. Not everything can or should be a fight.
Especially here, using the thing should actuall make you feel better and your life easier, not to make your life harder.

If you are trying to fight for your privacy to an extreme end, that is fine, use a complex password for each site, and memorize them all.
But remember, that you only have limited fighting energy. So prioritize your limited energy on the most pressing issue.


## Dear reader...

You are doing great! And you can do it. I have, and it was nice and easy. You can too.
