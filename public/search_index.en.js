find myself seated in the passenger's seat of my mother's car, as we make our way to an appointment with an educational psychologist. A sense of confusion and concern lingers within me, stemming from my mother's sudden and puzzling reaction to my C-graded report card. The journey passes quietly, and we arrive at the specialist's office without exchanging a word, leaving me still uncertain about the purpose of our visit.\nThe psychologist initiates our session by administering a series of aptitude and intelligence tests appropriate for my age. Throughout the process, my mother's keen gaze remains fixed on me, intensifying my nerves. Eventually, the psychologist validates my mother's suspicions, revealing that my intellectual capabilities far exceed those of my peers. This revelation prompts my mother to shed light on the purpose of our enigmatic expedition: “You see, you are not stupid, you are actually very smart, you just lack self-esteem!” Was that truly the root of the issue? While self-esteem was a factor in my unhappniess, I couldn't help but feel that my lack of effort had deeper origins.\nOh, but this wasn't the first round of this comical saga. You see, on previous occasions, my dear mother would strategically place a glass of water right between us, like a cosmic prop. And what was the grand purpose behind this visual spectacle, you might ask? Well, it was her way of nudging me into a philosophical monologue about that very glass. In simple terms: \"Hey, kiddo, you've got a shortage of optimism; you're the sort who tends to spot the half-empty glass in life.\"\nAnd then we have my dear old dad, the master of responsibility training. He had this grand plan to shape my character, using internships as his secret weapon. \"Off you go, my young apprentice!\" he'd exclaim, nudging me into one vocational adventure after another. His hidden message? \"Kid, I'm passing down the sacred skill of handling responsibilities!\" Ah, the age-old dance of parental strategy.\nAnd there you have it, my childhood summed up, right from the time those kindergarten teachers began their chorus of complaints about my apparent \"refusal\" to embrace the songs that my peers had effortlessly committed to memory months before.\nAs the days went by, I began to adopt a personal mantra: \"I'm the poster child for laziness, the embodiment of irresponsibility, with motivation and vision nowhere to be found.\" Oddly enough, despite knowing full well the significance of education and being genuinely captivated by the realms of science and math, my actions seemed to tell a different story altogether. It's as if I was presenting evidence that contradicted my own beliefs. Perhaps deep down, I questioned my care for my parents, struggled to find motivation, or maybe I secretly aspired to master the art of freeloadery.\nThe haze of doubt began to lift when I embarked on an ADHD medication journey, and lo and behold, I experienced the novel sensation of being able to sit down and read a paragraph without my mind spiraling into chaos. It was like finally playing a video game where you no longer wonder if you're in control of that character's movements or not. My epiphany was quite the reverse: \"Oh, wait a minute, I can indeed make decisions and stick with them?\"\nLet me tell you, this realization was liberating, to put it mildly. Suddenly, I had the capacity to invest time in the very things that had ignited my curiosity.\nADHD has had a profound impact on my life since childhood. One revelation that became clear after seeking medication was the extent to which I had surrendered agency and intentionality.\nMy existence had been defined by reactivity, with a noticeable absence of honed decision-making skills. I found myself in a state of passivity, or even worse, mere reactivity.\nNonetheless, I consistently strived to reclaim it.\n\nRecent Victories\nOver the past few years, I've encountered an almost comically disproportionate share of misfortune and have found myself under substantial duress. Yet, I've navigated my way through these challenges.\nI won't delve into the specifics of these misfortunes, although those in my social circles can attest to their unusual frequency.\nHowever, I can share that I've achieved several noteworthy milestones during this time span: acquiring programming skills, entering the workforce, entering marriage, and most recently, opting to unofficially change my name.\nFormally, I remain Amirhossein, and I'm content should anyone choose to continue addressing me as such—I hold no animosity toward it. Nevertheless, it inadequately captures the depth of my identity.\nAmirhossein and Perma\nThe name Amirhossein is a composite of two Arabic names, Amir and Hossein, both of which carry two meanings. As for the firsts  of these meanings, Amir translates to \"prince,\" while Hossein signifies \"Good-junior.\" The amalgamation results in the interpretation of \"Junior Good Prince.\"\nHowever, I find myself at a loss when attempting to establish a personal connection with any aspect of this interpretation of this name. This brings us to its secondary and perhaps more intended connotation.\nIn Shia Islam, there exists a concept akin to Christianity's sainthood, known as \"Imam.\" However, these Imams are asserted to be leaders of the Islamic community. The first of these figures holds the title \"Amir-al-momenin,\" or the \"prince of the faithful,\" commonly abbreviated as Amir. The third Imam, the second son of the first, was named Hossein. Both individuals deviate significantly from pacifism.\nWhile these historical and linguistic connections hold merit, I must underscore a significant twist: since the age of 15, I have consciously disavowed Islam and theism in their entirety.\nI find \"Perma\" to be a more fitting option, resonating more harmoniously with my ears. Moreover, it aligns with certain themes and passions that hold significance in my life.\nIt closely aligns with the ethos underpinning this blog. I'm captivated by the philosophy of the Permaculture and Permacomputing movements—albeit not necessarily their current implementations. My fascination lies in harmonizing with the world rather than coercing it to conform to my presence.\nMoreover, the notion of leaving a lasting imprint on the world holds a special allure for me. However, this yearning leans more toward the aesthetic realm rather than being rooted in utilitarian aspirations.\nDear reader...\nIf you've known me previously, you might have observed my recent shifts in usernames, emails, and name. Across the internet, I've opted for Prma instead of the more direct Perma, as the latter is frequently claimed or could serve other entities more fittingly.\nHowever, this change isn't indicative of a complete unveiling of my authentic self. Thus, referring to me by my previous name isn't as insensitive as the act of deadnaming. Rather, this transition signifies the inception of a renewed chapter, one marked by heightened purpose and intention.\nWhile I do prefer and hope for the usage of \"Perma\" moving forward, I'm entirely at ease if you choose otherwise. Your decision in this regard is genuinely respected.\n\n\n  Comment section? I have none.\n  But feel free to email me at: prma.dev@protonmail.com\n","id":"https://prma.dev/call-me-perma/","title":"Call Me Perma"},"https://prma.dev/consider_developers_snack/":{"body":"\nDuring my early 20s, I found myself immersed in the world of sustainable architecture as an architecture student.\nEngaging in various workshops centered around this field, one particular experience stands out as a monumental turning point in my life.\nIt was a workshop conducted by a renowned professor in Iran, where I gained valuable insights.\nWithin this workshop, we collectively brainstormed strategies to harness heat sources for a four-member family's house,\naiming to optimize its thermal efficiency.\nWe considered a range of possibilities, including solar and geothermal heat, as well as the heat generated by the kitchen oven.\nHowever, there was one significant heat source that eluded our attention, as pointed out persistently by the professor.\nEventually, he provided us with a clue: \"You seem to have overlooked four 37-degree Celsius heaters.\"\nIt dawned on us that we had forgotten to factor in the heat generated by the family members themselves.\nTheir body heat, a natural source of warmth, had slipped our minds entirely.\nReflecting on a more recent occurrence, a certain paper began circulating, comparing the energy usage footprint of different programming languages.\nYet,\nI couldn't help but notice that the discussions surrounding this paper overlooked\na crucial aspect—it solely measured the energy footprint at one specific point in the application's lifecycle.\nIt is essential to recognize that the energy usage of a programming language extends beyond a mere snapshot analysis.\nTo truly grasp the overall impact,\nwe must consider the entire lifecycle of the application,\naccounting for factors such as development, deployment, maintenance, and eventual retirement.\nOnly then can we gain a comprehensive understanding of the energy implications associated with different programming languages.\n\nThe Paper, As The Thread We Pull\nThe paper,\ntitled \"Energy Efficiency Across Programming Languages,\"\ndelves into the exploration of various problems and their corresponding solutions,\nwhich are implemented across multiple programming languages.\nThe researchers conducted an analysis of the electricity consumption associated with each implementation.\nIn essence, the primary focus of the study revolves around determining the relative energy efficiency of different programming languages,\nwith C emerging as the most efficient and serving as the benchmark for measurement.\nC      | 01.00 | ▓ \nRust   | 01.03 | ▓\n.\n.\n.\nJava   | 01.98 | ▓▓\n.\n.\n. \nPython | 75.88 |

carry considerable weight,\nalthough it is essential to address a common misconception surrounding their implications.\nContrary to popular belief,\nthese findings do not unequivocally assert that a C program is\ninherently more environmentally sustainable than its Java counterpart.\nConsider The Snack\nIn the field of sustainability literature, there exists a concept known as Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA).\nLCA involves evaluating the environmental impact of a product throughout its entire life cycle,\nencompassing aspects such as raw material extraction, manufacturing, and disposal or recycling.\nWhen applying this concept to the assessment of software life cycles,\nwe realize that there are several significant factors that have been overlooked.\nAllow me to provide some insights on these important considerations.\nFirstly, the authors of the paper have primarily focused on the runtime of a specific set of problems.\nThis means that their applications follow a sequence of starting up, solving the given problem, and then exiting.\nConsequently, the results obtained are biased towards programming languages that excel at efficient startup and shutdown processes.\nHowever, this perspective fails to account for the behavior of servers and long-running processes.\nServers, for instance, typically start up once per day or even less frequently and spend extended periods in the computational phase.\nIf a programming language is efficient during the initial startup but requires frequent restarts during runtime, this crucial aspect is overlooked.\nBut we shouldn't stop there.\nAnother aspect to consider is compilation.\nWhile Rust is indeed an impressive language, its compilation process is significantly more resource-intensive compared to Go.\nRust yields highly efficient binaries, but the energy expended during the compilation process is also considerably higher.\nFurthermore, the improved quality of Rust's compiled binaries becomes relevant when\nwe consider the potential presence of bugs and the subsequent need for recompilation.\nMore permissive compilers may result in programs with a higher likelihood of bugs,\nnecessitating additional rounds of debugging, fixing, and retesting.\nIt's important to acknowledge that this discussion goes beyond the developer's running computer\nand includes factors such as sustenance needs,\nenergy consumption to support their biological functioning during the process of bug fixing,\nand the overall impact on the environment.\nAdditionally, the continuous deployment or release cycles, repackaging efforts,\nand the use of CI/CD practices all contribute to the ecological footprint.\nRecompilation for each platform targeted,\nas well as the network costs associated with distributing binaries or source code to different endpoints,\nalso significantly impact the environment.\nThe problem of compatibility further compounds the issue.\nProgramming languages with runtimes shipped separately from the package,\nsuch as Python, Lua, and other scripting or JIT languages, as well as those based on virtual machines like JVM,\noften require reprogramming or the inclusion of older runtime versions when breaking changes occur.\nThis adds to the complexity and environmental impact of software development and packaging.\nFurthermore, poorly designed programs can accumulate significant technical debt over time, resulting in rewriting.\nAlthough the language and toolchain themselves may not directly cause this,\nthe ecosystem surrounding languages like JavaScript, PHP, and Python tends to encourage short-term thinking.\nIn contrast, languages like Rust, C, Fortran, and others that focus on system-level development promote long-term support\nand are home to projects that have thrived for several decades.\nMoreover, the variability in usage patterns must be taken into account.\nWhile languages like C and C++ require substantial energy for compilation across different platforms,\nlanguages such as Rust, Go, and Java mitigate the duplication of energy required to support multiple platforms within a single application.\nFinally, we must consider the energy expended in the development, maintenance, and support of programming languages.\nLanguages like Rust offer remarkable expressive capabilities,\nnot merely due to better timing or superior thinking but also as a result of extensive collaborative efforts.\nConversely, languages like Elm undergo minimal changes over time.\nIt is worth emphasizing that the energy required to learn a language,\nthe environmental consequences of mistakes made during coding\n(e.g., unintentionally sending a million requests to thousands of different servers),\nvariations in energy usage among developers from different countries,\nand the decreasing lifespan of hardware are all factors that contribute to the overall consideration\nDear Reader...\nThe crux of the matter is that complexity pervades these considerations,\ndemanding our thoughtful attention and appropriate mitigation for each aspect.\nFailing to acknowledge and address each facet places us at risk of optimizing solely for one element\nwhile sacrificing the other to the extent of rendering our efforts absurd.\nIt is important to note that I have deliberately omitted discussions about post-harm mitigation.\nOur focus has been on reducing harm itself.\nExploring the costs associated with bootstrapping and averting catastrophic scenarios\nwould expand beyond the scope of this essay.\n\n\n  Comment section?

Allow me to enumerate them concisely for clarity:\n\nBloated beyond reason.\nPlagued with incessant ads.\nPrioritizing feature over bug fixes, if addressed at all.\nDesigned to cater to journalists and advertisers, neglecting your needs.\nImposing confinement and isolation upon you.\nFailing to empower users like yourself.\n\nA Brief Digression\nThe final point warrants further elaboration.\nThe internet is, in fact, a tool.\nIt is something that is made to help someone achieve some goal.\nThe captivating world of Web 2.0 and Social Media (the somethings) - initially promising to empower people (the someones),\ngranting them enriched social connections (the some goal).\nA promising start, indeed, leaving many with pleasant experiences during the inception of Web 2.0.\nBut, alas, as time went by,\nthe very incentives that drove these Social Media companies veered them off\ntheir intended course.\nThey embarked on a divergent path, straying from their professed mission, and now,\nWeb 2.0 primarily serves as a platform to amplify the voices of journalists and celebrities (the actual someones),\npropelling them towards greater fame and recognition (the actual some goals).\nThe driving force behind these shifts?\nThe ever-persistent quest for revenue from advertisers,\npushing them to create content that captures maximum engagement.\nThe more captivating, the more lucrative.\nRegrettably,\nthe landscape has birthed what I would call the \"four horsemen of reactionary engagement\":\nthe doomsday, super political reporter;\nthe enraging, populist racist politician;\nthe trolling, impulsive CEO;\nand the drama-driven, vacuous celebrity.\nIn a nutshell, it appears you've been played for a fool.\nSocial media's purported aim of empowering you is nothing but a delusion.\nGo Empower yourself\nBefore you proceed, there's a prerequisite to address:\novercoming the fear of missing out.\nNow, how one achieves this is not within my scope to divulge,\nbut I can assist you in understanding why these fears are unfounded.\nConsider this:\nHave you truly missed out on anything of genuine importance?\nReflect on whether the latest controversial statement from Donald Trump has genuinely altered the course of your life.\nAnd if it did, was Twitter (or whatever they dub it these days) truly the sole or optimal medium for receiving such information?\nEven in Iran, where official channels are notorious for propagating falsehoods, Twitter appears to be excessive.\nFor me, friends and private messages reliably convey essential information.\nAnd indeed, individuals might spend considerable time on Twitter, but isn't the fundamental pledge of social media the relay of information? If that need is already being fulfilled through other means, what purpose does Twitter truly serve?\nIf you find yourself fortunate enough to reside in a country with trustworthy official channels,\nand your well-being hinges on crucial information like hurricane alerts,\nrest assured that dedicated services cater specifically to such needs.\nSimilarly, if you derive pleasure from reading news articles,\nI suggest identifying the authors whose work you value and following them directly.\nHowever, if these activities do not align with your interests, then quite frankly,\nyou have no real necessity for engaging with this \"stuff.\"\nOh, my friend, let me share with you a sobering truth about these companies - they're akin to emotionally abusive partners,\nmanipulating you into believing you're nothing without them.\nThey demean you, calling you stupid and incapable of managing your life without their presence.\nThey cunningly weave a narrative of how your life is all thanks to them, that your friendships exist solely because of their benevolence.\nBut don't be fooled by their deceiving ways.\nThey mangle your interactions, force-feeding you ads and utter nonsense, all while claiming it's an act of love.\nAnd when their misdeeds come to light, they stage a grand spectacle of apologies and vows to change, only to strike back even harder later on.\nIt's time to break free from this toxic cycle.\nI know it's daunting, and fear may grip your heart initially, but liberate yourself from their clutches.\nYou will discover a life far better than you ever imagined.\nYou deserve more than this relentless manipulation.\nEmbrace the freedom that awaits, my dear friend.\nHow to find a good tool\nStep One: Find The Low Hanging Fruits\nYou stand at the precipice of transformation,\nready to change your life for the better.\nThe first step is to identify the areas in your life that require attention.\nWhat needs are you seeking to fulfill?\nAnd upon which inadequate services are you currently relying?\nIn my case, I sought:\n\nA steady flow of lightweight information.\nDaily interactions with fellow enthusiasts akin to myself.\nA means to uncover specific data.\nA reliable way to send emails.\n\nFor too long, I depended on subpar sources to meet these needs.\nFor the first two, I found myself reliant on Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, and Google News.\nAs for the third and fourth requirements, I resorted to Google's services.\nHowever, all of these platforms consistently fell short and inflicted undue stress upon me. \nStep Two: Find Effective Replacements\nIn my earlier post I have mentioned that I already have replaced most of these services with better ones. \nBut I have not mentioned what constitutes an effective solution.\nIn my previous post, I alluded to having replaced many of these services with superior alternatives.\nHowever, I haven't delved into what exactly makes a solution effective.\nAllow me to outline the criteria and guiding principles for an empowering tool:\n\nIt should not cause you any harm. \nIt should not lock you in.\nIt should not feel frugal. \n\nNow, let me delve into the rationale behind these criteria:\n1. It should not cause you more harm than good\nIf a tool causes more harm than good, why persist in using it at all?\nTo safeguard your interests, ensure that the tool operates with transparency.\nPlatforms that intentionally harm users are less inclined to be forthcoming about their inner workings.\nOpt for open-source and audited software, provided you trust the incentives and capabilities of the auditors, as this fosters transparency.\nMoreover, it is crucial to align the incentives of the tool's creators with your own.\nWhile there will always be some degree of misalignment, not all cases are equal.\nSelling or renting software may incentivize developers to plan for obsolescence, sell incomplete products, or enforce lock-ins.\nYet, these misalignments are overshadowed by the egregious discrepancies inherent in ad-driven models.\n2. It should not lock you in\nIndeed, the peril of being locked into a tool becomes evident when the company's incentives undergo a shift.\nI experienced this firsthand in 2015 when I was a loyal Evernote user with a premium subscription, trusting it with all my valuable information.\nHowever, when Evernote decided to drop right-to-left language support crucial for the Middle Eastern languages, my pleas for assistance fell on deaf ears.\nThey deemed the region unworthy of attention, leaving me stranded and unable to utilize my data effectively.\nThe true pain emerged when I attempted to export my information and realized I was trapped in their ecosystem.\nThey held my notes hostage, providing them back only in a non-standard format through XML or JSON files.\nThis, my friends, was the dreaded lock-in, and I had to endure a labyrinthine journey of manual extraction to break free.\nTo avoid such a predicament, one essential question should be posed:\n\n\"Will it be more difficult for me to switch to a competitor once I've fully adopted this service compared to my current situation before using it?\"\n\nIf the service retains your data and only offers it back in a non-standard format,\nit becomes significantly more challenging to transition to a competitor after investing your notes into the first service.\nBe vigilant and consider the implications before getting entangled in such situations.\n3. It should not feel frugal.\nLet us keep in mind the essence of this endeavor: to enhance the quality of our lives.\nUndoubtedly, there are noble causes that may necessitate adopting a certain level of frugality, as was the case for me with animal rights, which amusingly led me to embrace veganism.\nHowever, advocating for these causes demands energy, and it might inadvertently lead to isolation.\nWe must acknowledge that not everything can or should be a constant battle.\nThe purpose of utilizing these tools is to improve our lives, not to make them more arduous.\nIf safeguarding your privacy to the utmost extreme is your goal, then by all means, employ complex passwords for each site and commit them to memory.\nNevertheless, we must be mindful that our fighting energy is finite.\nThus, it becomes essential to prioritize and channel our limited energy toward the most urgent and meaningful issues that truly resonate with our hearts.\nDear reader...\nYou are on the right path, and I believe in you wholeheartedly!\nTrust me, I've been through this journey myself, and it turned out to be a delightful and straightforward experience.\nTake heart, for you can certainly achieve it too! Keep going, and you'll soon realize how much better and easier life becomes.\nYou've got this!\n\n\n  Comment section?

It leaves no room for pride in one's work.\nAs a result, engineers who value quality find satisfaction in other avenues,\nsuch as personal projects or contributing to libraries and tools they use themselves.\nThe dynamics of development in these situations differ.\nOpen-source software often lacks the same level of resources,\nmaking maintainability a crucial concern.\nAllowing technical debt to accumulate in a project one maintains can result in paying a hefty price, even in a short period.\nThe more users a project has,\nthe more the burden of technical debt becomes apparent—quite the opposite of the industry's \"move broken things, fast\" mentality.\nConsequently, successful open-source products tend to have meticulous and uncompromising maintainers.\nAnother important aspect to consider is that open-source software greatly enhances one's resume.\nSimilar to a resume, open-source projects showcase an individual's best work.\nThey are like first dates, where you present yourself at your best.\nConsequently, open-source projects motivate developers to create their finest code and documentation.\nFurthermore, transparency is a vital aspect of open-source projects.\nEngaging in dubious practices, such as intrusive telemetry, can agitate the surrounding community.\nIn summary, there are four main reasons:\n\nThe cost of maintainability\nThe positive impact on one's resume\nCounteracting the lack of satisfaction caused by lower quality software in daily work\nEmbracing transparency\n\nFLOSS exhibits a greater degree of diversity.\nWhen it comes to a biological ecosystem, its resilience stems from the diversity of its members.\nLet's imagine a scenario involving a moth that feeds on maple tree branches.\nIn a jungle filled with maple trees, the moth can feast and reproduce endlessly.\nHowever, there's a twist.\nAround 10% of the maple trees have developed a variation of their membrane that is toxic to the moth, purely by chance.\nNow, if the moth tries to feed on these trees, it has a 1 in 10 chance of being fatally poisoned.\nIf there were only a single moth, it would be the end of its lineage.\nHowever, imagine a population of 100 moths, and 10% of them have accidentally developed immunity.\nThese \"super moths\" may be larger and more resistant to the trees,\nbut they are also more visible to predators like birds.\nAnd so, the cycle continues.\nThe diversity of approaches within a biological ecosystem is crucial.\nIn the context of biological beings,\nthe exchange of random sets of genes through sexual reproduction likely emerged as a means to enhance resilience.\nMicrobes that prey on others, on the other hand, face a more challenging situation, as the result.\nThese advantageous mechanisms resulting from diversity are also present in the software ecosystem.\nThe needs and threats faced by a server differ from those faced by a German student's laptop.\nWhile Linux is ubiquitous in the open-source desktop realm,\nthere are numerous slightly different Linux distributions available.\nThese variations encompass different themes,\npreinstalled applications, package managers,\nand even packaging architecture models.\nAdditionally, there are kernels compiled with different flags and versions.\nGiven this remarkable diversity,\nit comes as little astonishment that Microsoft's ardent campaign during the 2000s against the comparably youthful,\nless cohesive, and resource-limited Linux met with abysmal failure.\nStrikingly, in a twist of events,\nMicrosoft has lately unveiled its very own Linux distribution and dedicated years to crafting the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nTo the proprietary realm, an ecosystem characterized by the development,\nredesign, and forking of diverse products, yielding a multitude of solutions, may appear inherently inefficient.\nYet, from the perspective of permaculture and permacomputing, such an ecosystem manifests as nothing short of utopia.\nFLOSS demonstrates a higher level of robustness.\nFLOSS transcends being a mere generator of independent variations that begin anew each time.\nIt represents a system where progress builds upon existing foundations, with each subsequent layer amplifying the importance of the underlying ones.\nIrrespective of how many stories above the ground one ascends, the ground level remains a paramount concern if its integrity is jeopardized.\nProminent examples of this phenomenon can be observed in projects like curl, the kernel, and OpenSSL.\nAlthough these initiatives were initially initiated by individuals, they have evolved into integral components of numerous other undertakings.\nThe driving force compelling many individuals to contribute to these projects stems from the realization that the cost of abstaining from participation would be significantly greater.\nHowever, it is important to recognize that this process is not always pleasant.\nConsider the immense pressure on OpenSSL developers.\nIf they were to become overwhelmed and exhausted like many other open-source maintainers, the consequences could be significant.\nYet, when such challenges arise (and they do), we all become aware of them.\nWe sense the danger and collectively strive to find solutions.\nThis is in stark contrast to the situation when a proprietary software developer abandons a company.\nUntil a replacement is found, users are left unaware and vulnerable to potential security threats posed by malicious hackers.\nThanks to this collective effort and attention to robustness,\nmany foundational open-source software programs have remained the best tools for the job even after decades of use.\nDear reader...\nNow, esteemed reader,\nI trust you comprehend the rationale behind why individuals with a penchant for enduring solutions\nfind the realm of FLOSS far more fertile than its alternatives.\n\n\n  Comment section?

I was curious about two main instances. \nOne being Fosstodon, an instance oriented around Free and Open-Source Software(FOSS), another being Hachyderm, an instance that introduces itself as \"social media for technical professionals\".\nEventualy, I decided to go with Fosstodon, as I liked what I was seeing there more.\nBut I couldn't put my finger on what it was that I liked more about Fosstodon, even though many of my favorite people resided on Hachyderm, the instance owner of the Hachyderm herself, being one examples.\n\n\nInitial Theories\nInitially I thought Hachyderm was more business-oriented. It seemed that people on Hachyderm were more interested about talking about broader technologies like kubernetes and docker, while at the same time there was a lot of talk about codes and programming practices.\nI thought maybe all the programmers on Hachyderm are working with more proprietory and enterprise solutions and as such they were less likely to share details of their daily programming.\nBut that theory didn't hold true, as there was as much toots in my timeline on Fosstodon about bussiness related stuff as there was on Hachyderm.\nUntil last night that I realized that maybe what I was seeing was the difference of ideas between Operations interested people vs people involved in developing software. And as a backend-developer, I could see more relevant content from the development side.\nSo I set to examine my assumptions.\nLike a good Baysian.\n\n\nAPIs, Searches and Methods\nto start with, I looked into different websites that could help me search per-instance results.\nThat way I could search differnet keywords in each instance and compare the results.\nHowever I could not find such a thing.

Let's say I'm dead set on accusing Tom of being a thieving scoundrel\nwhile vehemently asserting that Amanda is as innocent as can be.\nTo make my case, I start off by drawing a sharp contrast between Tom and Amanda.\nThen, after much contemplation, I concoct a ridiculously specific definition of a thief:\n\"Anyone who happens to be a man in his sixties with an academic background in History.\" Can you believe that?

It simply won't fly, and anyone with half a brain can see how utterly flawed and impractical that notion is.\nThe Turing Completeness\nNow, let me tell you about those folks who prefer a more unified approach when it comes to defining something, like a programming language.\nThey often rely on axioms, you know, those fundamental principles that serve as the bedrock of reasoning.\nOne of the most famous examples is the notion of Turing completeness being the ultimate defining factor.\nAt first glance, it may not seem problematic.\nBut here's the burning question: Why on earth would we go down that route?\nThink about it.\nWe create distinctions in definitions to aid us in effectively communicating a concept amongst ourselves.\nAs far as I know, most programmers couldn't care less about whether a\nprogramming language can perform every single computation imaginable in theory.\nNo, sir!

What a ridiculous state of affairs!\nDear reader...\nNow, let me be clear, my intention here is not to rally behind HTML and extol its virtues.\nInstead, I aim to shed light on our incessant desire to bestow added significance upon the definition of our work.\nAnd, quite frankly, I implore you to put an end to it.\nYou see, a programming language can possess capabilities or be lacking in them,\nand a programmer may be focused on orchestrating the flow of information or on its presentation.\nWe come in all shapes and forms, each with our unique approaches.\nAttempting to establish some sort of gatekeeping mechanism in this endeavor will only result\nin programmers overlooking the fact that they may just require HTML and CSS to fulfill their job requirements.\nThis, in turn, contributes to the sorry state of the web—bloated and disheartening.\nLet us cherish our roles as creators and refrain from placing undue emphasis on the definition of our jobs,\nbut rather, let us focus on the outcomes we produce.\nAfter all, we are all creators and problem-solvers at heart.\n\n\n  Comment section?

So you probably don't need to read on. \nI know, I hate the title as well. But I couldn't resist. \nSo here is another, better title:\n\nMoving a Variable to a Function in Rust Doesn't Make It Impure\nSo as an introduction, if you don't know Rust: \nIn Rust, we have this concept of moving variables.\nIt is like this: \n//  A variable is made. \nlet a_variable = some_value; \n\n// It moves into this function.\n_ = a_function_that_takes_ownership(a_variable);\n\n// We cannot use a_variable anymore! So, we cannot do this!\nlet b_variable = a_variable; \n  \n\nNow I consider a_function_that_takes_ownership to be a pure function.\nHowever, it raises a possible confusion:\n\nDoesn't a_function_that_takes_ownership change the state of the outer function?\nIsn't that a side effect?\n\nI argue that it doesn't. Here is why: a function is not a function call. Ok. let's visualize it. \n      ________outer_function_______\n--in-&gt;|       __inner_f___        |-out-&gt;\n      | -in-&gt; |          | -out-&gt; |\n      |       ------------        |\n      -----------------------------\n\nSo we have two functions. One outer, and one inner.\n\nEach function should have inputs and an output.\nOther than their outputs, they should not change anything outside their function space. \n\nIf these conditions are not met, our function is not pure.\nStep 1. Now consider a variable [V].\n      _____________________________\n-----&gt;| [v]   ____________        |-----&gt;\n      | ----&gt; |          | -----&gt; |\n      |       ------------        |\n      -----------------------------\n\nStep 2. With our outer function, we create a function call for the inner function. \n      _____________________________\n-----&gt;|       ____________        |-----&gt;\n      | [v]-&gt; |          | -----&gt; |\n      |       ------------        |\n      -----------------------------\n\nStep 3. It is no longer in the state space of the outer function. The inner function takes ownership of it.\n      _____________________________\n-----&gt;|       ____________        |-----&gt;\n      | ----&gt; |   [v]    | -----&gt; |\n      |       ------------        |\n      -----------------------------\n\nSemantically, for the outer function [v] was used in the function call and then dropped. Which does not violate our rules.\nFor the inner function, it just got an input and returns an output. \nSo it makes sematic sense. \nIn practice, it also makes the same guarantees as any other pure function:\n\nNo null pointers. \nNo mutable state. \nNo side effects. \n\nIf the caller .clone() our value and make a copy of it and pass that to the inner function,\nit provides us with no other guarantees, other than more memory usage and slightly longer code.\nWhy does it matter?\nWell, Honestly, it doesn't.\nI just had to decide if in a pure function I can consume a self, if I want to make it a pure function, considering that I cannot make it const.\nThis was my thinking output. Now you are the outer function. \n\n\n  Comment section?

\nSuch governments end up becoming extremely rich.\nBut because people are not required for the government to perform, \nmost of what the government is doing is providing value for the few that can provide them the resources they need.\nSuch governments nations are subject to low progression in the civic laws,\nare extremely hard to change, and form strong bonds with few entities.\nAs people are seen as a barrier,\ngovernment's like this tend to have a lot of controversial and theatrical surfaces,\nbut end-up deciding things behind closed doors.\n\nThink of: USA during recent years, as it managed to put a huge people's involvement. \n\nLow Centrality, Low Natural-Resources, Low People-involvement\nThese governments are stable, but irrelevant.\nThey fail to bring order, or protection for their people.\nAnd they don't provide any infrastructural benefits the society.\n\nThink of: Afghanistan Right after USA army left it.\n\nLow Centrality, Low Natural-Resource, High People-involvement\nThis, at least for now, seems to be some what the better of them all, but with some caveats.\nThese governments are highly stable, and highly motivated by providing value to the people.\nThey accumulate wealth and culture overtime.\nThey are, also, resilient to hostile neighbours and bad actors.\nThese societies tend to look good on the outside, but much better on the inside.\nHowever, such governments are only weak to adapt to any radical changes, as the changes only happen when the people will it to happen.\nThat means that these societies tend not to be the leaders or experimenters of different sorts of progress.\nHowever, they may end up reaching the top of the leader board in time. \n\nThink of: Germany, today. \n\nHow does it relate to the Twitter and Fediverse and ...?\nWell, there is a analogy to be made here. \nWe can see the body(s) that runs, maintains, develop and moderate a social network as a form of a government.\nThe users as the people and society.\nAnd the way that the proverbial social-network governments are being funded as the determining factor of people's involvement in governance.\nIn that regard we can think of Twitter, Facebook as highly concentrated.\nConsidering that their power is immensely related to the number of users they have,\nwe may be tempted to see them as somewhat of high in involvement of people.\nbut in actuality, people do not need to be actually participating in governing such a system.\nAs they are the product, and the value comes from external means. \nThat means that the users ended up being the natural resource of the land that is being sold for resources to the external actors.\nAs such we end up with both exploitation of the users and their lack of ownership of their own data.\nSo, what can be the solution?\nConsidering how unfortunate this situation is, there has always been a few different alternatives. \nLet's just review them.\nThere are systems that don't count users as product, but as the customer.\nSuch services, though small have a better record of listening to users. \nHowever, as any centralized system, they are unstable, they remain small, and to keep users, they resort to vendor lock-ins. \nThey also resort advertisement instead of increasing real value.\nThink of apple with its anti-advertisement campaigns against Microsoft.\nAnother solution might be highly centralized systems without any sort of resources.\nThese tend to be highly volatile and fast to disappear.\nSo, decentralization might be the way to go.\nAs low-centrality but highly-resourcefulness goes, I can only think of mailing groups.\nMailing groups stand on the shoulders of mail providers.\nDecentralized as mailing is, the ecosystem overwhelmingly is provided by a few company that their main products are again, people.\nAs discussed earlier, such systems tend to not have much progress. At least, not for the non-governing bodies.\nAnd indeed, that has been true.\nMailing and mailing groups is as user friendly and featureful as they have been 15 years ago. \nWhich makes us resort to our last option.\nLow centrality and High involvement of people.\nSuch a system has been the model for open-source development.\nWhere the governance is highly motivated to help the people the same time as the people are highly motivated to help the governance.\nSuch a model has ended up being extended into forms of social governance.\nWhere users fund their instances, help development and do volunteer moderations. \nAnd indeed, again, the parallel is not surprising:\nThese systems tend not to have the greatest of the starts, but they end up enduring, and becoming more resilient. \nMastodon, Pixelfed and other federated, open-sourced social networks, operate in such a model.\nAnd I like to think of people moving from Twitter to Mastodon as realizing that they matter and can should be more.\nCredit\nThis work is highly inspired and heavily reliant on Daron Acemoglu's fantastic book, Why Nations Fail.\nA must read.\n\n\n  Comment section?

Let's make it concrete.\nMaking it more concrete\nHere is a function in Rust that we will work on:\nfn main() {\n  // Calling `calculate_my_lateness` seems like magic.\n  // We don't know how it calculates it, and why it is doing that.\n  let mut status: bool;\n  calculate_my_lateness(&amp;mut status);\n\n  // This sometimes crashes and sometimes, it does not.\n  assert_eq!(status, true);\n}\n\n// The point of this function is to tell us if we are late\n// Ask yourself, how would you write a test for such a function?\nfn calculate_my_lateness(status: &amp;mut bool) {\n    let current_time = std::time::SystemTime::now();\n    let expected_time = std::time::SystemTime::from(SOME_SPECIFIED_TIME);\n\n    status = current_time &lt;= date_time;\n}\n\nNow, let's make it pure and while we are at it, we introduce pure functions and some principles as well.\nPure functions return at least one output\nThat means that if you have a function named some_function, you will have at least one argument some_input and it will return at least one output some_output.\nfn some_function(some_input) -&gt; some_output\n\nWhy do we do this? When we are calling a function, we are expecting something to happen.\nIn FP world, the only acceptable something is an output argument.\nA lack of output is symptomatic of one of these two unacceptable situations:\n\nOur function does nothing. In which case, why are we even bothering to write it at all?\nOur function is doing a side effect. Which means that it is changing something other than what is inside the function.\nThese functions don't let us know or control what they are doing inside, without making us look at the source code.\nWe will get back to this throughout this post.\n\n\nPlease note the emphasis on symptomatic.\n\nSo let's make it return the output:\nfn main() {\n  let mut status: bool;\n  let output = calculate_my_lateness(&amp;mut status);\n  //--^^^^^^------------ we have an output now\n\n  assert_eq!(output, true);\n  //---------^^^^^^----- which we use here\n}\n\nfn calculate_my_lateness(status: &amp;mut bool) -&gt; bool {\n    //-notice that we are returning something--^^^^--\n\n    let current_time = std::time::SystemTime::now();\n    let expected_time = std::time::SystemTime::from(SOME_SPECIFIED_TIME);\n\n    status = current_time &lt;= date_time;\n\n    status // &lt;- what we are returning\n}\n\nPure functions don't mutate state\nAs I mentioned before, a function does something when it returns something and changes the state of something outside itself.\nWe call that a side effect.\nYou may have noticed that our function takes a mutable variable of type bool and changes it.\nIn our first iteration of the function, we needed it. But now, we grew out of it. So let's just delete it.\nfn main() {\n  // let mut status: bool;  &lt;- we don't need this\n\n  let output = calculate_my_lateness();\n  //--------------------------------^ we don't need to take status any more\n\n  assert_eq!(output, true);\n}\n\nfn calculate_my_lateness() -&gt; bool {\n    //------------------^^- we don't need to take a mutable variable\n\n    let current_time = std::time::SystemTime::now();\n    let expected_time = std::time::SystemTime::from(SOME_SPECIFIED_TIME);\n\n    current_time &lt;= date_time //  &lt;- what we are returning\n}\n\nNow isn't this better? When I call calculate_my_lateness()\nI'm not worried about the function changing anything it's not supposed to anymore.\nLet's move on.\nPure functions return output only based on their argument\nWhich means that when I call calculate_my_lateness(), I should not expect it to do something different each time I run it.\nWhy is that? There are two reasons:\n\nTransparency: You should know what parameters change the output of a function, without needing to reading the function body.\nTesting: It is hell of a lot easier to test a function that you can just control without needing to change the time of your computer. Won't you say?\n\nLet's do it in two steps this time.\nStep one: Don't use global variables\nyou may have noticed SOME_SPECIFIED_TIME.\nThis is a variable we use to make a SystemTime which we compare current time with to know if we are late or not.\nThe problem here is these two:\n\nWe need to write a new function, each time we have a new meeting.\nWe also don't know what time current time is being compared to, unless we first read the function, and then find out what it uses as SOME_SPECIFIED_TIME.\n\nfn main() {\n  let output = calculate_my_lateness(SystemTime::from(SOME_SPECIFIED_TIME));\n  //---------------------------------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-\n  // now the caller is supposed to provide the time\n\n  assert_eq!(output, true);\n}\n\nfn calculate_my_lateness(late_as_of: SystemTime) -&gt; bool {\n    //-------------------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-----------\n\n    let current_time = std::time::SystemTime::now();\n\n    current_time &lt;= late_as_of\n}\n\nStep Two: don't use functions with side effects inside your function\nImagine that you have a non-alcoholic drink, if you add another non-alcoholic drink to it, it is still non-alcoholic.\nBut if you add an alcoholic drink to it, it will not remain non-alcoholic anymore.\nA pure function is only pure, if all the functions that are being called in it, are pure.\nAnd std::time:SystemTime::now() is definitely not pure.\nNow, at some point we need to get the current time, but we don't need to do that where it is hidden from the caller.\nfn main() {\n  let output = calculate_my_lateness(\n                   SystemTime::from(SOME_SPECIFIED_TIME),\n                   SystemTime::now(),//&lt;------ we provide the time\n  );\n\n  assert_eq!(output, true);\n}\n\nfn calculate_my_lateness(late_as_of: SystemTime, target_time: SystemTime ) -&gt; bool {\n    //-------------------------------------------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-----------\n    target_time &lt;= late_as_of\n}\n\nNow the nice thing here is that we can easily test this function now!\n// main and calculate_my_lateness are not shown here. Don't be alarmed.\n\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::calculate_my_lateness;\n    use std::time::SystemTime;\n\n    #[test]\n    fn being_late_works() {\n        let res = calculate_my_lateness(\n            SystemTime::from(A_TIME),\n            SystemTime::from(A_TIME_THAT_IS_AFTER_LATE_TIME),\n        );\n        assert_eq!(res, true)\n    }\n\n    #[test]\n    fn being_early_works() {\n        let res = calculate_my_lateness(\n            SystemTime::from(A_TIME),\n            SystemTime::from(A_TIME_THAT_IS_BEFORE_LATE_TIME),\n        );\n        assert_eq!(res, false)\n    }\n}\n\nImagine doing this with the first function!\nOne more step\nOK, I lied... Somewhat. Have you noticed the one glaring, lack of transparency and control here?\nIt's the &lt;=. You may need to read the function here, if you have this simple question:\n\nIf I call the function exactly, at the precise moment that I specified to be late_as_of, will return true, or false?\n\nNow, not answering this question using the function signature,\nwon't make my function less pure,\nbut still, it is a much nicer experience for the caller to be able to rely on their IDE's autocomplete to tell them what happens.\nBut how the hell should we do that? Easy! We take a comparator function as input!\nfn main() {\n  let output = calculate_my_lateness(\n                   SystemTime::from(SOME_SPECIFIED_TIME),\n                   SystemTime::now(),\n                   |late, target| target &gt; late, // here the caller passes the function\n                                                 // you can also provide a few different functions yourself to make it easier for the caller\n  );\n\n  assert_eq!(output, true);\n}\n\nfn calculate_my_lateness(\n    late_as_of: SystemTime,\n    target_time: SystemTime,\n    comparer: fn(SystemTime, SystemTime) -&gt; bool, // magic happens here\n) -&gt; bool {\n    comparer(late_as_of, target_time)\n}\n\nNow the caller is providing us we have everything we need. We did not hide one single thing.\nIsn't this just more work for caller?\nWell, yes. Yes, it is... if calling functions without understanding them is the only work that the caller of our function is doing.\nOtherwise, our caller knows everything they need using their language server, can change everything they need, have the assurance of our tests and don't need to crawl through our source code, and they will face much fewer bugs where they don't know where it came from.\nIt may seem unnecessary for this simple function, but imagine much more complex functions.\nMaking things nicer: A spicy problem\nSo we have all this power and transparency.\nBut the elephant is in it room: We have a very shitty API.\nLet's make it nicer using a technique called currying (hence the \"spicy\" pun).\nWhat it means is: as well as taking functions as argument, we can return functions.\nThat way, our calculate_my_lateness function can become a function-maker.\nLet me make it more concrete.\nConsider the use case\nLet us suppose that we want to find time in our list of times that is not late.\nCurrently, we have to call the whole function, repeatedly, and include every argument.\n// we are in main, don't be alarmed\nlet output_time1 = calculate_my_lateness(\n    SystemTime::from(SOME_SPECIFIED_TIME),\n    SystemTime::from(FIRST_TIME), //&lt;------ we provide the time\n    |late, target| target &gt; late,\n);\n\nlet output_time2 = calculate_my_lateness(\n    SystemTime::from(SOME_SPECIFIED_TIME),\n    SystemTime::from(SECOND_TIME), //&lt;------ we provide the time\n    |late, target| target &gt; late,\n);\n\nlet output_time3 = calculate_my_lateness(\n    SystemTime::from(SOME_SPECIFIED_TIME),\n    SystemTime::from(THIRD_TIME), //&lt;------ we provide the time\n    |late, target| target &gt; late,\n);\n\n// etc...\n\nThis is not great.\nHere, We can just make a function that only takes our target time.\nfn calculate_my_lateness(\n    late_as_of: SystemTime,\n    // target_time: SystemTime &lt;------------ we don't need to take this argument anymore\n    comparer: fn(late_as_of: SystemTime, target_time: SystemTime) -&gt; bool,\n) -&gt; fn(target_time: SystemTime) -&gt; bool {\n     //^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^---- notice that we are now returning a function\n\n    |target_time: SystemTime| -&gt; bool { comparer(target_time, late_as_of) }\n    //^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    //         |                this is where the calculation of lateness happens\n    // we are taking target time here\n }\n\nYou might ask, \"well, how does this help?\"\n// we are in  main\n\n// now our late_before_time_x is not of type bool,\n// rather it is of type Fn(SystemTime) -&gt; bool\nlet late_before_time_x = calculate_my_lateness(\n    SystemTime::from(SOME_SPECIFIED_TIME),\n    |late, target| target &gt; late,\n);\n\n// So we can just:\nlet first_result = late_before_time_x(FIRST_TIME);\nlet second_result = late_before_time_x(SECOND_TIME);\nlet third_result = late_before_time_x(THIRD_TIME);\n// ...much less boilerplate\n\nWhy const just won't do\nVeteran rustaceans among the readers of this blog might ask: \"why not just use const to mark that functions are pure?\"\nWell dear veteran, if you can make a function const, do every one a favor and actually do it.\nIn fact, I regularly use clippy::missing_const_for_fn lint and suggest you to use it as well.\nBut that does not guarantee that our functions are pure, or that every pure function can be const.\nHere are my reasons:\n\nconst functions can take &amp;mut something as their arguments. Taking mutable references is definitely not very pure-function-y.\nYou cannot const trait methods in stable rust, as of now. And considering that every function call inside a const function should be const as well, you are extremely limited, without any reasons that have to do with pure functions.\nMany libraries don't to use const on the functions that are const. Again, limitation without pureness reasons.\n\nMaking things declarative\nThere is this often repeated old joke from Phil Karlton that says:\n\nThere two hard problems in programming\n\nCache invalidation\nNaming things\nAnd here we are concerned with the second one.\n\n\n\nIn the imperative universe, we usually name our functions using verbs. Think calculate_my_lateness.\nIn the declarative universe we are concerned with our output, we use nouns. Think lateness_calculator.\n\nThis makes the intent of our function clear.\nHow it is implemented under-the-hood is not what matters to the caller.\nThey only care about what they get out of it.\nIf you now are thinking that you cared about that part before, consider the things that we just can answer by seeing the arguments that our function takes.\nWe don't need to rely on our function name anymore to tell use how the function is calculating lateness.\nWe only need to know what it's intention is.\nBye without iterators?\nIn this post, I just preferred to focus on the heart of functional programming: pure declarative functions.\nHowever, functional programming brings with it a set of extremely useful tools, patterns, etc. most well known are iterators, maps, folds, filters and....\nHonestly, they are well explained in other resources. My only suggestion would be to check out itertools crate.\n\n\n  Comment section?

But more often than not, you might need to choose one over the other.\nIt is compared in the niche the other fails. Like low-level system development, which Rust easily rules. \nOr maybe dev-ops tooling which Go is easily good at it. \nHowever, there are many overlaps in their use case.\nThink high-performance web-servers.\nIn those spaces, we should compare other things. Like readability and maintainability of language.\nIn this post, I want to share my thoughts on readability.\n\nTL;DR\nRust is not less maintainable than Go because Go is less readable.\nWhat I do not disagree with\nJust to be clear, although I'm making a case for Rust and arguing that readability should not be as much concern,\nI would like to make clear that I'm not arguing against these common-sense statements: \n\nGo is more readable.\nGo has less overhead for people with no previous experience with language.\nReadability is generally what you want.\n\nWhy readability is good\nEnglish is more readable than any programming language. However, readability is not the only measure that we are using for chosing a language.\nReadability and clearity are not inherently good, rather it is a proxy for something else we value: \nA readable code helps us understand the flow of information in order to understand its logic, capture its bugs and extend it, easier.\nA line of code is read in many situations: \n\nI want to find out how a piece of code can give rise to a specific runtime bug. \nI want to audit it to see if it exposes any specific vulnerability, data-race, etc.\nI want to add features to it, and I want to know where and how I should plug the new functionality to.\nI want to make a code more robust, document it and make it more available for other people by refactoring it.\nI want to review the code of my colleague to see if a set of fresh eyes could capture a new bug, or an inconsistent styling with the rest of the codebase.\nI want to understand what a code base does. Maybe I'm trying to see if a software is spying on me, or maybe I'm trying to understand the way it calculated my taxes.\n\nThese are all noble pursuits. And in all these cases, readability is vital in preventing disasters and better experience in onboarding others.\nGo's readability is probably one of its best features. At my current and previous jobs,\nI have had to jump into different code bases with different levels of legacy and problematic codebases where junior developers with no-idea of idiomatic ways of coding Go left their projects without any context for the next developer.\nSuch low quality codes should take forever for one to decode. However, because of the beautifully simple syntax of Go, I could start to be productive and sending PRs in less than a day.\nHave you seen a codebase where all the back-end code was coded by a narcissistic lone-wolf meth-addict? Well, I have, and it's an absolute shit-show. Yet, I committed my first edits in 3 hours.\nGo is excellent at that. And I can understand how a huge tech company with very quick employee turn-over can give rise to such language.\nKudos to the Go team.\nRust does not need readability\nNot As much, anyway. \nUnlike its name, Rust usually finds a third way.\nFor example, if you have thought a language should either be performant yet unsafe, or be less-performant and have a mark-and-sweep garbage-collector,\nRust will defy your limits by using a new semantic approach to manage memory which while possesses the speed of manual memory management,\nit is yet much more memory safe than most garbage collected languages.\nWhen it comes to readability, Rust is vastly less readable than go, on the other hand, it handles many of the core reasons we need readability using compile-time checks.\nLet us consider the situations we have mentioned before.\n\nRust has a very strong emphasis on handling errors and panicking, and exceptions are heavily discouraged. You can use things such as clippy::expect_used and clippy::expect_used and clippy::panic linters to prevent the code from compiling if at any point you have used them. Basically, you can write a total program. \nRust uses many linters and is heavily protected by its compiler against many security bugs. It has a semantic way of preventing memory leaks and data-races. Many of the common audits are not necessary when language itself makes the vulnerability impossible to happen. \nRust has a very extensive and strong type-system. This means that you can be very explicit about the APIs of each package and each crate. This means that the language-server and IDE can easily help you with using those APIs in such a way that, for example, Go with a type-system much smaller, could not.\nRust's compiler allows for explicitly making policy about documentation and styling. For example, you can make it impossible for a code to compile if every public API is not documented, or if the document doesn't cover errors. The test runner also checks if the example's in the documentation are not running. This helps in enforcing good documentation practices for the engineering team.\nRust's compiler is very hard to convince of compiling. Every line of code should work perfectly. If a code can compile and pass Clippy lints and test runner, there is little left for the reviewer of the code. The reviewer should only concern themselves with the business-logic of the code.\nThe expressiveness of the type system allows for functions that enforce business logic, in their function signature and type constructors. Rust also adopts a declarative naming convention, which helps with communicating intentions. \n\nAll these points mean that most of the needs of readability are either covered by the compiler or the idioms are well enough that you don't have to worry about the complexity of syntax.\nRust's compiler does most of the reading for you, you do the writing, my friend. \nYou can compare this approach by saying that rust allows for a compile-time robustness, while Go helps with runtime-maturing.\nAnd hence, Rust is optimized for the time of the writing. Not ad-hoc corrections, which is what Go is excels at.\nHow should it affect your decisions\nWhere Go's approach excels at\nI consider Kubernetes to be the perfect example of a project that Go is perfect for.\nA super readable language is great for when massive amounts of unfamiliar engineers need to change the code base constantly, and their changes are examined by themselves.\nSuch situations come up with projects that are usually providing a thin layer of API over different platforms, and when you expect the project to be truly forked, constantly. \nIn such platforms, you expect, and welcome a lot of hit-and-run contributions and you expect the code to be easily changeable.\nThe code does not need to be perfect at all times, as the users are expected to be perfectly capable of patching the codebase, at least for their own use-case.\nWhere Rust's approach excels at\nAlthough I expect it to be controversial, I find web-servers to be the epitome of what Rust is good for. \nI consider Rust to be perfect for a software where you want each deploy to be perfect.\nEach commit with Rust can be double-checked by the compiler, Clippy, cargo-audit cargo-deny and many other tools.\nUsing its expressive type-system you can make functions pure, ensure totality and model data in a way that most other languages can only dream of. \nNow, I know that many people consider Go to be excellent at making web servers.\nAs a back-end developer who has chosen Go to be my main language for business, I agree with you. Go is splendid for web servers.\nBut I strongly suggest that you give Rust a try if back-end development in Go is your thing.\nYou would be extremely surprised at how exceptionally well Rust is at this task.\n\n\n  Comment section? I have none.\n  But feel free to email me at: prma.dev@protonmail.com\n","id":"https://prma.dev/readability_tradeoffs/","title":"Go vs. Rust's Readability Trade-offs: Better Safe Than Sorry"},"https://prma.dev/the-tragedy-of-the-tech-stacks/":{"body":"\nBack in 1958, there was this thinker named Garrett Hardin who kicked off his well-known piece titled \"The Tragedy of the Commons\" in the following way: \n\nAt the end of a thoughtful article on the future of nuclear war, Weisner and York concluded that \"Both sides of the arms race are ... confronted by the dillema of steadily increasing military power and steadily decreasing natonal security. It is our considered our professional judgment that this delimma has not professional technical solution. If the great powers continue to look for solutions in the area of science and technology only, the result will be to worsen the situation.\"\n\nThen, Hardin goes on to rattle the foundations by delving into a colossal issue – the challenge of population expansion. He breaks it down by saying that when you have a shared resource, and each individual aims to squeeze out the most benefit for themselves, the result is a harm inflicted upon everyone, even the very ones taking those actions.\nNow, picture this famous analogy. Imagine a stretch of grassland, claimed by three farmers. Each of them brings their cow out to graze on it daily. Sounds reasonable, right? But then, one fortunate farmer's cow becomes pregnant. This stroke of luck leaves him with two cows, effectively doubling his profits. Observing this triumph, the other farmers follow suit, diving into a spree of buying and breeding cows, aiming to maximize their individual gains. However, this frenzy leads to a rampant grazing that leaves the grassland bare and barren. Ultimately, the once lush grass disappears, and the insatiable appetite of the voracious cows brings about their own starvation. In the end, all the farmers are left with no cows, their initial wealth transformed into a state even worse than before.\nHe coins it as the \"tragedy of the commons.\" I prefer to see it as a powerful representation of what often dampens the enjoyment across the software terrain for every key player involved: the user, the developer, the CEO, and the investor.\nHow meta!\n\nThe Clever One, The Frustrated One and The Scared One\nNow, let's meet a familiar figure, the one we often encounter, the embodiment of many developers out there. We'll give her a name: Sarah. Sarah's eager to dive into a fresh technology – one that could potentially elevate her current position. So, how does she tackle this? She begins by exploring a domain, and within that, she sets her sights on a specific technology. Let's designate this domain as something imaginary, to prevent any inadvertent offense. How about we refer to it as \"front-end development\"?\nFor fron-end Sarah finds out a few different contenders in the field. She asks herself, what could the industry be thirsty for? The naive answer she arrives at, is \"the most reliable one, the one that is the pleasure to develop and the one that has the most advantages\". Oh, Sarah, you impractical idealistic perfectionist, you! \nNow, delving into the realm of front-end, Sarah stumbles upon a handful of potential contenders. She ponders, what might the industry truly crave? Her initial, somewhat naive response is, \"The most dependable option, the one that brings joy to the development process, and the one that boasts numerous advantages.\" Oh Sarah, you, impractical, idealistic, perfectionist you!\nArmed with these benchmarks, she opts for the Elm language (yet another mythical being). She proceeds to dive into Elm, driven by her enthusiasm. However, curiosity gets the better of her, and she sneakily glances at the job listings on LinkedIn. To her astonishment, she discovers a mere trio of job opportunities for Elm. This baffles her, leading her to question the accuracy of her initial language assessment.\nSeeking insight, she turns to Tom, an exceptional CTO she's acquainted with, to discuss whether Elm lives up to its hype. Much to Sarah's astonishment, Tom echoes her initial convictions regarding Elm. He affirms that, indeed, Elm proves to be an exceptional language, boasting enduring dependability, a well-established ecosystem, and a delightful development journey.\nSarah, now even more puzzled than before, directs her confusion towards Tom, questioning whether he's in the process of recruiting Elm developers. Once again, Tom's response is resolute: \"Absolutely not! Where could I possibly locate a pool of Elm-savvy developers? However, we're actively seeking out JavaScript experts!\" (once more, a language name sufficiently distanced from any existing real-world instances).\nAfter a brief moment of contemplation, Sarah bursts out, \"Well, what about me?\"\nTom responds with a shake of his head, stating, \"Oh, that wouldn't work. You see, for any given application, we require a team of 20 individuals to consistently handle maintenance and bug fixes. Where on earth would we come across 20 Elm developers?\"\n\"Well, shouldn't Elm apps theoretically require significantly less maintenance, given the multitude of bugs that are caught during the initial development stages?\" Sarah counters silently within her mind. An idea begins to form, one she opts to keep to herself, \"Ah, so maintaining a delicate codebase might indicate a higher demand for fresh JavaScript developers – implying enhanced job security!\"\nFeeling rather clever, she decides to validate her hunch by perusing the (imaginary) yellow pages, named Glassdoor. And lo and behold, an endless scroll unveils a plethora of distinct job listings, all centered around JavaScript.\nWell, Sarah learns javascript and all her beliefs gets validated, she becomes a very wealthy engineer, with a great job security, with each company she enters trying to keep her, year-after-yer, while other companies trying to persuade her by higher and higher offers. Or at least that was the boring version of this post that did not start with the word \"tragedy\". \nInstead, she uncovers that her counterparts, much like herself, had also been quite clever. A multitude of newcomers gravitated towards the language flaunting the highest job listings. Each job opening faced a surplus of around a hundred contenders. The \"victor,\" so to speak, emerges as the individual boasting the most qualifications and the most modest salary expectation. Or should we even label them as victors, considering that the instant they dare to dream a little bigger, a fresh job listing crops up, promptly displacing them with the next eager contender.\nTom, our trusty CTO, worn out from the cycle of on-boarding one low-budget, novice developer after another, vents his frustrations to the CEO. The CEO engages in discussions with the investors, who share the same dissatisfaction due to their profits being eroded by an inefficient workforce. They call upon the CEO to devise a remedy for this predicament.\nThe CEO returns with a strategy to shift from JavaScript to Elm technology. The investors, content with the proposal, take a brief pause to deliberate. A few days later, they rejoin the conversation, expressing a notable apprehension. \"Elm is practically unheard of! None of our rivals employ this language. That's a substantial gamble we're not prepared to take!\"\nArash, the CEO, CTO, CFO, Product Manager, and the visionary founder of a fledgling startup, confronts the very same imaginative quandary of selecting a technology stack.\nGiven the inherent high-stakes nature of startups, Arash adopts a prudent approach by examining the practices of more established corporations, such as those overseen by individuals like Tom in his role as CTO, in order to identify a tried-and-true trajectory.\nThe Lose-Lose-Lose situation\nAt every juncture, every individual optimized their decisions for personal gain. At each instance, a superior option was presented, and they acknowledged the benefits it offered. Nevertheless, they settled for the inferior alternative (for the sake of avoiding any unnecessary debate, let's refrain from mentioning that the hypothetical lesser choice was JavaScript, naturally). As a result, each person finds themselves in a less advantageous position than if they had collectively embraced the superior alternative. This impact ripples beyond individuals, extending to the entire ecosystem, hindered by the precarious edifice of abstractions left behind by the swiftly growing number of predecessors.\nSo, why did they all fall short of enhancing their own lives and the lives of others? Was it the technology's flaw? Or did the ecosystem falter? You're astute enough to deduce the answer; after all, you had the wit to discern the languages I implicitly referred to in my hypothetical scenarios.\nThe Solution\nI must admit, I'm uncertain. The nuclear arsenal continues to expand, even though the era of the Cold War has long passed. Thankfully, our world hasn't been ravaged by nuclear conflict. Rather, it's the interplay of mutually assured destruction and the realization by the leaders of those two nations that not embracing an alternative risk could lead to dire consequences. This, at least, has placed us in a relatively improved state.\nSimultaneously, we find ourselves grappling with Garrett Hardin's preoccupation – the persistent challenges of overpopulation and looming environmental catastrophes. Evidently, the far-reaching peril of not embracing an alternative is of such extended duration that it transcends the immediate concerns of the very generation opting against alternatives. The burden of their choices is instead borne by their descendants: \"Fuck those brats.\"\nIn the world of software, the tempo is notably faster, the stakes less dire compared to earlier circumstances, and the individuals engaged are often more honest than politicians and notably smarter than the average voter.\nHowever, the remedy doesn't entail adhering to an oddly precise series of ritualistic maneuvers. It's a more daunting challenge. Just as Garrett Hardin titled his article, the solution remains much the same:\n\nThe population problem has no technical solution; it requires a fundamental extension of in morality.\n\nDear Readers...\nI know! The gastly claim of \"to improve developer experience we first should grow an ethical sense\", seems absurd. \nYet I see no specifically little amount of gradual change, where at least some one on the whole chain did not bite the bullet and risk it. \n\n\n  Comment section?

I grappled with doubts.\nThen, as if destiny had a hand in it, the second revelation struck—a website called Kagi, delivering yet another blow to the illusion I had held onto.\nThe cracks in my previous beliefs widened, challenging me to confront the harsh realities of the digital landscape.\nKagi, an unconventional paid search engine, piqued my curiosity, prompting me to give it a try.\nWhat unfolded before my eyes left me astounded—a screen brimming with blog posts dedicated to the concept of \"permacomputing\" occupied the very first page of results.\nIn that moment, it dawned on me that the beloved world of independent blogging, which I had presumed to be on life support, had not faded away as I had believed.\nInstead, it thrived, resilient and as potent as ever.\nIt was the so-called social media platforms and search engines, the very entities I had placed my trust in, that had ultimately let me down, betraying the internet I held dear.\nThe illusion that once clouded my perception had dissipated into thin air.\nDetermined to instigate a change, I embarked on a journey of transformation.\nI am currently in the midst of that process, but I have successfully identified the type of experience I desire.\nI have pinpointed a few readily available opportunities and have taken proactive measures to secure them for myself.\nForemost, I yearn for an authentic perspective of the internet—a genuine representation of the collective human experience rather than a mere showcase of the glossiest and most superficial elements.\nTo fulfill this aspiration, I sought out a suitable search engine, and as I mentioned earlier, I found my answer in Kagi—it aligns perfectly with my vision.\nFurthermore, I crave a steady stream of thoughtful and sincere content.\nTo achieve this, I turned to an RSS aggregator to curate and deliver such material to me consistently.\nFeedbin emerged as the ideal choice, serving as the conduit for fulfilling my appetite for meaningful discourse.\nI discovered another low-hanging fruit on my path towards a more fulfilling online experience—a social website optimized for community rather than being driven solely by journalists.\nThis gem came in the form of Mastodon.\nIn my quest for a trustworthy email service that respects my privacy and shields me from the relentless influx of spammers, I received a recommendation for ProtonMail.\nTaking heed of the suggestion, I made the switch and, so far, I find it to be a satisfactory choice.\nYou may have noticed that out of the four aforementioned solutions, three are paid services.\nAdditionally, two of them are closed-sourced, while one—the email service—poses the risk of vendor lock-in.\nAlthough this may not be the ideal scenario, I weighed my options against a set of criteria that I had established.\nIn the end, these choices emerged as the better alternatives, despite their limitations.\nHowever, I realize that this post has already grown quite lengthy, and the criteria I employed deserve a more thorough elaboration.\nTherefore, I will save their exploration for a future post, where I can delve deeper into these ideas deserving of greater attention.\nDear reader...\nAt present, I find immense joy in my renewed online experience—a sense of tranquility and refuge washes over me whenever I delve into the internet.\nI wholeheartedly urge you, dear reader, who may be experiencing similar frustrations to those of my past self, to take a moment and reevaluate your internet usage.\nThere is a strong possibility that the internet can be a much more pleasant and gratifying space than what you might be feeling at this moment.\nI know this to be true because I am living it right now.\nEmbrace the journey of exploring better alternatives and reclaim the joy in your online interactions.\n\n\n  Comment section?
