Although it lacks the letter "e" due to the unavailability of <code>perma.dev</code>, it admirably fulfills its purpose. It's important to recognize that permanence does not equate to perfection; rather, it entails acknowledging and embracing the inherent imperfections transparently.<h2 id=The_Scope>The Scope</h2><p>This blog transcends the boundaries of perma-computing, as its title serves as a testament to my own viewpoint and endorsement of the concept. What truly captivates me is the exploration of tools and methodologies that facilitate the development of enduring software solutions.<h2 id=The_Need:_The_Pitfalls_of_Disposable_Culture_and_the_Quest_for_Quality>The Need: The Pitfalls of Disposable Culture and the Quest for Quality</h2><p>It is of utmost importance to acknowledge the inherent impermanence that permeates every aspect of life. However, if we continue down the path of wholeheartedly embracing impermanence, we will inevitably face our own downfall, as individuals, as a civilization, and as a species.<p>Regrettably, this notion has become deeply ingrained in our society, where the tools and products we rely upon have become increasingly disposable and cheaply made. We find ourselves amassing a staggering array of subpar possessions that succumb to inevitable breakage within a mere couple of years, if not less. Consequently, our primary concern shifts to the constant pursuit of the next disposable acquisition.<p>This lack of agency perpetuates a ceaseless cycle of squandering time and resources on the perpetual replacement of broken items. It is akin to inhabiting a rental property rather than owning a homeâ€”when we know we won't be there for more than a brief stint, our motivation to improve our living environment dwindles.<p>As a result, our overall quality of life suffers immensely. Our surroundings are dominated by a sea of low-quality, disposable commodities, and we hesitate to invest in superior alternatives due to the ever-looming thought of the next disposable wave that will inevitably crash upon us in a couple of years, thus perpetuating this vicious cycle.<p>Inevitably, this mindset contributes to environmental catastrophes, akin to the detrimental impact of choosing plastic cups over reusable ones. We simply cannot afford to settle for mediocrity and substandard quality in all aspects of our existence. It is imperative that we rise above this prevailing norm and strive for excellence, for the sake of our own well-being and that of our planet.</main><footer><p class=taxonomies></footer></div>
