      <title>Python And NixOS</title>

      <description>The problems surrounding Python programs on NixOS seem never-ending. I often have to refrain from installing most Python programs. On each update, another one of them breaks during installation â€“ either their tests don&amp;rsquo;t pass, or their dependencies fail in some way.
And to be honest, I give the benefit of the doubt to NixOS, seeing its result with other languages, and knowing what I know about pip.</description>

      <title>Test of 10x Developer</title>

      <description>The true test of 10x developer is that you put two of them together, each debugging each others code, then you if they kept their 10x status, they are the true 10x developer. My guess would be that their population will reduce to less than that of unicorns&#39;.</description>

      <title>Usage Restriction of Software Licenses</title>

      <description>Please think twice before saying, usage restriction is good because you might want to prevent someone from using your tool for war, crime, etc.
Like, you know that a poorly enforced license won&amp;rsquo;t deter a person in that situation from using your software, right?
There are probably better arguments for including usage restrictions in a software license; this one is a terrible one.</description>

      <title>Centralization Around GitHub</title>

      <description>I find the situation around GitHub centralization distressing. And this extreme relience on GitHub is worrying. Maybe in time things change. But the moment I find a job and thus don&amp;rsquo;t need to keep my repos on GitHub anymore, I would like to move to a more federated forge. Codeberg seems like the closest option. I will just simply mirror my commits to GitHub for the time being, slowly retiring them when I&amp;rsquo;m sure that codeberg remotes have the necessary configurations and flows that are needed.</description>

      <description>It is very illuminating to see that using older style technologies, may lead to better experience. This just goes to show that many of the features and complexity and progress are not for people, but for profit of a few. That, of course, is a wild speculation of the highest order.</description>

      <description>I think when you are proposing a fast prototyping phase in programming, you should he able to answer these questions:
What don&amp;rsquo;t we know that we hope to find out with this prototype?
Why is this the best approach for finding the answer to that question.
When is the prototype going to be deleted?
If you are cannot answer to these questions, what you are proposing is not a prototype, it is prototype quality end product.</description>

      <title>Rust Skills Transferability</title>

      <description>While the skills learned in Rust , like working with the borrow checker, may seem limited to Rust itself, the claim of their intransferability is somewhat overstated. Understanding the borrow checker is specific to languages using it, but the approaches it encourages are typically advanced and valued by experienced engineers. And often, it is evidenced by the patterns that are simplest to implement. The obvious exception to that is unwrap() and expect().</description>

      <guid>https://prma.dev/posts/rust-productivity/</guid>
      <description>I think the best way to characterize Rust &amp;rsquo;s productivity, is to put it on a quality axis.
If you want low quality code (prototyping, etc) rust is much less productive than the alternative.
For medium level of quality, Rust is similar to others.
For high quality code, Rust is much more productive than any alternatives.
Quality is intentionally vague, to encapsulate performance, leanness, documentation, and security.</description>

      <guid>https://prma.dev/posts/dynamic-linking-the-wrong-solution/</guid>
      <description>Dynamic linking for the reason of security is the wrong solution, only propagating the problem of language and application developers to the downstream package distrobuters. It is basically saying, yeah, I wrote this package with this language and dependencies, but you will be the one paying for my choice of technology. Of course, down stream people also shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have accommodated these softwares. Except they did and now, there are multitudes of ecosystems operating this way.</description>

      <description>Intro Back in 1958, there was this thinker named Garrett Hardin who kicked off his well-known piece titled &amp;ldquo;The Tragedy of the Commons&amp;rdquo; in the following way:
At the end of a thoughtful article on the future of nuclear war, Weisner and York concluded that &amp;ldquo;Both sides of the arms race are &amp;hellip; confronted by the dillema of steadily increasing military power and steadily decreasing natonal security. It is our considered our professional judgment that this delimma has not professional technical solution.</description>

      <description>I find myself seated in the passenger&amp;rsquo;s seat of my mother&amp;rsquo;s car, as we make our way to an appointment with an educational psychologist. A sense of confusion and concern lingers within me, stemming from my mother&amp;rsquo;s sudden and puzzling reaction to my C-graded report card. The journey passes quietly, and we arrive at the specialist&amp;rsquo;s office without exchanging a word, leaving me still uncertain about the purpose of our visit.</description>

      <guid>https://prma.dev/posts/dishonesty_of_optimizing_for_developers_time/</guid>
      <description>Intro Based on some individuals&amp;rsquo; viewpoints, they emphasize optimizing for developer time or productivity as their main priority, rather than giving top precedence to aspects such as performance, robustness, or correctness.
The Thesis Their argument revolves around the idea that developers&amp;rsquo; time is more valuable and expensive than server resources. They often use phrases like &amp;ldquo;You can always refactor,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;You can always optimize for performance,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;We will fix bugs later on&amp;rdquo; to support their viewpoint.</description>

      <description>Intro The web is utterly fucked. But anyone with some resources resources at hand and curiosity at heart and intentional tool selection can have a decent experience.
The Reasons The web&amp;rsquo;s lamentable state can be attributed to several factors. Allow me to enumerate them concisely for clarity:
Bloated beyond reason. Plagued with incessant ads. Prioritizing feature over bug fixes, if addressed at all. Designed to cater to journalists and advertisers, neglecting your needs.</description>

The communication channels of that era felt more personal, more akin to a lively conversation passed on through word of mouth.
More of Those Days In those youthful days, I&amp;rsquo;d eagerly scour the web for words that piqued the interests of my teenage self, and with a simple search, Google would present me with a treasure trove of blogs authored by kindred spirits.</description>

      <description>Intro Ah yes, the eternal dispute over whether HTML counts as a proper programming language seems to bring out the best and worst of our community&amp;rsquo;s collective rational faculties. A veritable feast of half-baked attempts to define away the problem by appealing to whatever convenient characteristics the speaker happens upon, combined with a sprinkling of more serious thinkers seeking some grand philosophical theory to explain it all. But don&amp;rsquo;t get your hopes up - you won&amp;rsquo;t find any silver bullet solutions here folks.</description>

      <description>Intro During my early 20s, I found myself immersed in the world of sustainable architecture as an architecture student. Engaging in various workshops centered around this field, one particular experience stands out as a monumental turning point in my life. It was a workshop conducted by a renowned professor in Iran, where I gained valuable insights. Within this workshop, we collectively brainstormed strategies to harness heat sources for a four-member family&amp;rsquo;s house, aiming to optimize its thermal efficiency.</description>

      <description>Intro Traditionally speaking, Go and Rust are not direct competitors on many fronts. Each take different trade-offs. But more often than not, you might need to choose one over the other. It is compared in the niche the other fails. Like low-level system development, which Rust easily rules. Or maybe dev-ops tooling which Go is easily good at it.
However, there are many overlaps in their use case. Think high-performance web-servers.</description>

      <guid>https://prma.dev/posts/moving_is_pure/</guid>
      <description>Intro The act of moving arguments within Rust &amp;rsquo;s functions serves as a compelling means to uphold the purity of the function. By embracing this practice, we ensure that the function operates on unique ownership of its inputs, preserving the integrity and immutability of data, which are fundamental tenets of functional programming.
Moving a Variable to a Function in Rust Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Make It Impure So as an introduction, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know Rust .</description>

      <description>Intro If you are not familiar with Functional Programming FP, you are in for a ride. I will try to explain FP in more practical terms.
A definition to work with FP is a declarative way of writing a program that consists mostly of pure functions that operate on and produce immutable data. That was many other unfamiliar words. Let&amp;rsquo;s make it concrete.
Making it more concrete Here is a function in Rust that we will work on:</description>

      <description>Intro Ever since I have moved to the mastodon platform after the great twitter migration. I was curious about two main instances. One being Fosstodon, an instance oriented around FOSS, another being Hachyderm, an instance that introduces itself as social media for technical professionals.
Eventualy, I decided to go with Fosstodon, as I liked what I was seeing there more. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put my finger on what it was that I liked more about Fosstodon, even though many of my favorite people resided on Hachyderm, the instance owner of the Hachyderm herself, being one examples.</description>

      <description>Intro Why do some nations fail and rise so quickly? The answer to this questions has a surprisingly relevant answer to the recent migrations from a Twitter to Mastodon.
Power Centrality Basically the idea is that:
In any system of governance the authority is constrained to the resources it has available. And for the authority to make a change, it has to answer to the resource providers. Given a set interdependent institutions one could form check-and-balance system.</description>
