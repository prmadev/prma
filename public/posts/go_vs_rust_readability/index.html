 are not direct competitors on many fronts. Each take different trade-offs. But more often than not, you might need to choose one over the other. It is compared in the niche the other fails.

<p>However, there are many overlaps in their use case. Think high-performance web-servers. In those spaces, we should compare other things. Like readability and maintainability of language. In this post, I want to share my thoughts on readability.</p>

 and arguing that readability should not be as much concern, I would like to make clear that I&rsquo;m not arguing against these common-sense statements:</p>

<li>

<li>Readability is generally what you want.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-readability-is-good">Why readability is good</h2>
<p>English is more readable than any programming language. However, readability is not the only measure that we are using for chosing a language.</p>
<p>Readability and clearity are not inherently good, rather it is a proxy for something else we value: A readable code helps us understand the flow of information in order to <strong>understand its logic</strong>, <strong>capture its bugs</strong> and <strong>extend it</strong>, easier. A line of code is read in many situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to find out how a piece of code can give rise to a specific runtime bug.</li>
<li>I want to audit it to see if it exposes any specific vulnerability, data-race, etc.</li>
<li>I want to add features to it, and I want to know where and how I should plug the new functionality to.</li>
<li>I want to make a code more robust, document it and make it more available for other people by refactoring it.</li>
<li>I want to review the code of my colleague to see if a set of fresh eyes could capture a new bug, or an inconsistent styling with the rest of the codebase.</li>
<li>I want to understand what a code base does. Maybe I&rsquo;m trying to see if a  software is spying on me, or maybe I&rsquo;m trying to understand the way it calculated my taxes.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are all noble pursuits. And in all these cases, readability is vital in preventing disasters and better experience in onboarding others.

























































<a class="language" href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>















































































&rsquo;s readability is probably one of its best features. At my current and previous jobs, I have had to jump into different code bases with different levels of legacy and problematic codebases where junior developers with no-idea of idiomatic ways of coding 
























































<a class="language" href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>















































































 left their projects without any context for the next developer.
Such low quality codes should take forever for one to decode. However, because of the beautifully simple syntax of 
























































<a class="language" href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>















































































, I could start to be productive and sending PRs in less than a day. Have you seen a codebase where all the back-end code was coded by a narcissistic lone-wolf meth-addict? Well, I have, and it&rsquo;s an absolute shit-show. Yet, I committed my first edits in 3 hours. 
























































<a class="language" href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>















































































 is excellent at that. And I can understand how a huge tech company with very quick employee turn-over can give rise to such language. Kudos to the

 team.</p>
