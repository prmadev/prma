Imagine a stretch of grassland, claimed by three farmers. Each of them brings their cow out to graze on it daily. Sounds reasonable, right? But then, one fortunate farmer\u0026rsquo;s cow becomes pregnant. This stroke of luck leaves him with two cows, effectively doubling his profits. Observing this triumph, the other farmers follow suit, diving into a spree of buying and breeding cows, aiming to maximize their individual gains. However, this frenzy leads to a rampant grazing that leaves the grassland bare and barren. Ultimately, the once lush grass disappears, and the insatiable appetite of the voracious cows brings about their own starvation. In the end, all the farmers are left with no cows, their initial wealth transformed into a state even worse than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe coins it as the \u0026ldquo;tragedy of the commons.\u0026rdquo; I prefer to see it as a powerful representation of what often dampens the enjoyment across the software terrain for every key player involved: the user, the developer, the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cabbr title=\"Chief Executive Officer\"\u003eCEO\u003c/abbr\u003e, and the investor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow meta!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-clever-one-the-frustrated-one-and-the-scared-one\"\u003eThe Clever One, The Frustrated One and The Scared One\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, let\u0026rsquo;s meet a familiar figure, the one we often encounter, the embodiment of many developers out there.

Engaging in various workshops centered around this field, one particular experience stands out as a monumental turning point in my life. It was a workshop conducted by a renowned professor in Iran, where I gained valuable insights.\nWithin this workshop, we collectively brainstormed strategies to harness heat sources for a four-member family\u0026rsquo;s house, aiming to optimize its thermal efficiency. We considered a range of possibilities, including solar and geothermal heat, as well as the heat generated by the kitchen oven. However, there was one significant heat source that eluded our attention, as pointed out persistently by the professor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, he provided us with a clue: \u0026ldquo;You seem to have overlooked four 37-degree Celsius heaters.\u0026rdquo; It dawned on us that we had forgotten to factor in the heat generated by the family members themselves. Their body heat, a natural source of warmth, had slipped our minds entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReflecting on a more recent occurrence, a certain paper began circulating, comparing the energy usage footprint of different programming languages.

To truly grasp the overall impact, we must consider the entire lifecycle of the application, accounting for factors such as development, deployment, maintenance, and eventual retirement.

Allow me to provide some insights on these important considerations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, the authors of the paper have primarily focused on the runtime of a specific set of problems. This means that their applications follow a sequence of starting up, solving the given problem, and then exiting. Consequently, the results obtained are biased towards programming languages that excel at efficient startup and shutdown processes. However, this perspective fails to account for the behavior of servers and long-running processes. Servers, for instance, typically start up once per day or even less frequently and spend extended periods in the computational phase. If a programming language is efficient during the initial startup but requires frequent restarts during runtime, this crucial aspect is overlooked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t stop there.

There are two major approaches: selling or renting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmall to mid-sized software companies predominantly prioritize the sale of their products. The concept of product longevity, while acknowledged as necessary, assumes a secondary role rather than being a central objective. Its primary function lies in establishing trust among consumers. Once the initial excitement surrounding the launch of a new and captivating product subsides, these companies swiftly shift their attention to the next innovation. The success of marketing these novel products heavily relies on users\u0026rsquo; fear of missing out and the perceived loss of functionality associated with the previous iteration. Unfortunately, this often leads to the inclusion of unnecessary features, deliberate planning for obsolescence, and resistance against the right to repair. In this cycle, longevity takes a backseat as the perpetual replacement of one product with another takes precedence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConversely, larger companies place a premium on the rental model for software. Instead of users owning the software outright, they opt for subscription-based payment models for continuous usage. One might assume that these companies would prioritize stability to retain their subscribers. However, practical implementation often takes a different route. These companies rely on monopolistic tactics, such as acquiring competitors or launching extensive marketing campaigns to stifle new entrants. In cases where competition persists, they resort to content exclusivity, coercing users to purchase their product alongside competitors\u0026rsquo; offerings. Consequently, users find themselves utilizing these products for prolonged periods not due to their exceptional quality, but rather because they perceive limited alternative options. The subscription model may make sense when paying for a service, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t align with current software development. Paying subscription for developing and bug-fix of a product is simply paying for the privilege of using an incomplete version of a product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, companies adopting a pay-for-enterprise-support model for open-source products, such as Canonical and Red Hat, exhibit commendable practices. Their primary emphasis lies on longevity. If the software is functioning adequately, their tasks are straightforward, eliminating the need to address the same issue repeatedly for each client. Longevity serves as both their evidence and modus operandi. They provide support for software that has already weathered numerous instabilities. They employ different development stages, such as alpha, unstable, stable, and long-term releases. These features can subsequently be passed on to other distributions with more robust objectives, such as REHL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough these companies may impose charges for bug fixes, their underlying offering revolves around selling stability and longevity (think \u003cem\u003eUbuntu Pro\u003c/em\u003e). This approach is not driven solely by inherent benevolence but rather stems from a lack of alternatives. They are unable to monopolize a product that can be cloned, forked, and utilized to initiate independent ventures. Nor can they vend software that others can fork, enhance, and sell at higher prices or even distribute for free. Their sole viable course of action entails creating a product that strikes a balance, avoiding both excessive limitations that render it futile and excessive complexity that complicates support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, business is just one piece of the puzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"engineers-prioritize-quality-over-quantity\"\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cabbr title=\"Free/Libre and Open Source Software\"\u003eFLOSS\u003c/abbr\u003e engineers prioritize quality over quantity\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we discussed, most businesses prioritize product quality only until it reaches a level sufficient for selling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis often leads to engineers being pushed and encouraged to develop faster, sacrificing quality and stability when it hinders \u0026ldquo;beating the competition to market.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m not alone in feeling dissatisfied with creating instant legacy products and leaving behind a trail of subpar, useless software.

Open-source software often lacks the same level of resources, making maintainability a crucial concern. Allowing technical debt to accumulate in a project one maintains can result in paying a hefty price, even in a short period. The more users a project has, the more the burden of technical debt becomes apparent-quite the opposite of the industry\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;move broken things, fast\u0026rdquo; mentality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsequently, successful open-source products tend to have meticulous and uncompromising maintainers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother important aspect to consider is that open-source software greatly enhances one\u0026rsquo;s resume. Similar to a resume, open-source projects showcase an individual\u0026rsquo;s best work. They are like first dates, where you present yourself at your best. Consequently, open-source projects motivate developers to create their finest code and documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, transparency is a vital aspect of open-source projects.

Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine a scenario involving a moth that feeds on maple tree branches. In a jungle filled with maple trees, the moth can feast and reproduce endlessly. However, there\u0026rsquo;s a twist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround 10% of the maple trees have developed a variation of their membrane that is toxic to the moth, purely by chance. Now, if the moth tries to feed on these trees, it has a 1 in 10 chance of being fatally poisoned. If there were only a single moth, it would be the end of its lineage. However, imagine a population of 100 moths, and 10% of them have accidentally developed immunity. These \u0026ldquo;super moths\u0026rdquo; may be larger and more resistant to the trees, but they are also more visible to predators like birds.

Irrespective of how many stories above the ground one ascends, the ground level remains a paramount concern if its integrity is jeopardized. Prominent examples of this phenomenon can be observed in projects like curl, the kernel, and OpenSSL. Although these initiatives were initially initiated by individuals, they have evolved into integral components of numerous other undertakings. The driving force compelling many individuals to contribute to these projects stems from the realization that the cost of abstaining from participation would be significantly greater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it is important to recognize that this process is not always pleasant.
