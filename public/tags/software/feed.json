It is our considered our professional judgment that this delimma has not professional technical solution. If the great powers continue to look for solutions in the area of science and technology only, the result will be to worsen the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen,    \n goes on to rattle the foundations by delving into a colossal issue - the challenge of population expansion. He breaks it down by saying that when you have a shared resource, and each individual aims to squeeze out the most benefit for themselves, the result is a harm inflicted upon everyone, even the very ones taking those actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, picture this famous analogy. Imagine a stretch of grassland, claimed by three farmers. Each of them brings their cow out to graze on it daily. Sounds reasonable, right? But then, one fortunate farmer\u0026rsquo;s cow becomes pregnant. This stroke of luck leaves him with two cows, effectively doubling his profits. Observing this triumph, the other farmers follow suit, diving into a spree of buying and breeding cows, aiming to maximize their individual gains. However, this frenzy leads to a rampant grazing that leaves the grassland bare and barren. Ultimately, the once lush grass disappears, and the insatiable appetite of the voracious cows brings about their own starvation. In the end, all the farmers are left with no cows, their initial wealth transformed into a state even worse than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe coins it as the \u0026ldquo;tragedy of the commons.\u0026rdquo; I prefer to see it as a powerful representation of what often dampens the enjoyment across the software terrain for every key player involved: the user, the developer, the \u003cabbr title=\"Chief Executive Officer\"\u003eCEO\u003c/abbr\u003e\n, and the investor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow meta!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-clever-one-the-frustrated-one-and-the-scared-one\"\u003eThe Clever One, The Frustrated One and The Scared One\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, let\u0026rsquo;s meet a familiar figure, the one we often encounter, the embodiment of many developers out there. We\u0026rsquo;ll give her a name: Sarah. Sarah\u0026rsquo;s eager to dive into a fresh technology - one that could potentially elevate her current position. So, how does she tackle this? She begins by exploring a domain, and within that, she sets her sights on a specific technology. Let\u0026rsquo;s designate this domain as something imaginary, to prevent any inadvertent offense. How about we refer to it as \u0026ldquo;Front-End Development\u0026rdquo;?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Front-End Sarah finds out a few different contenders in the field. She asks herself, what could the industry be thirsty for? The naive answer she arrives at, is \u0026ldquo;the most reliable one, the one that is the pleasure to develop and the one that has the most advantages\u0026rdquo;. Oh, Sarah, you impractical idealistic perfectionist, you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, delving into the realm of Front-End, Sarah stumbles upon a handful of potential contenders. She ponders, what might the industry truly crave? Her initial, somewhat naive response is, \u0026ldquo;The most dependable option, the one that brings joy to the development process, and the one that boasts numerous advantages.\u0026rdquo; Oh Sarah, you, impractical, idealistic, perfectionist you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmed with these benchmarks, she opts for the \u003ca class=\"language\" href=\"https://elm-lang.org/\"\u003eElm\u003c/a\u003e\n language (yet another mythical being). She proceeds to dive into \u003ca class=\"language\" href=\"https://elm-lang.org/\"\u003eElm\u003c/a\u003e\n, driven by her enthusiasm. However, curiosity gets the better of her, and she sneakily glances at the job listings on LinkedIn. To her astonishment, she discovers a mere trio of job opportunities for \u003ca class=\"language\" href=\"https://elm-lang.org/\"\u003eElm\u003c/a\u003e\n. This baffles her, leading her to question the accuracy of her initial language assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeking insight, she turns to Tom, an exceptional \n she\u0026rsquo;s acquainted with, to discuss whether \u003ca class=\"language\" href=\"https://elm-lang.org/\"\u003eElm\u003c/a\u003e\n lives up to its hype. Much to Sarah\u0026rsquo;s astonishment, Tom echoes her initial convictions regarding \u003ca class=\"language\" href=\"https://elm-lang.org/\"\u003eElm\u003c/a\u003e\n. He affirms that, indeed, \u003ca class=\"language\" href=\"https://elm-lang.org/\"\u003eElm\u003c/a\u003e\n proves to be an exceptional language, boasting enduring dependability, a well-established ecosystem, and a delightful development journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah, now even more puzzled than before, directs her confusion towards Tom, questioning whether he\u0026rsquo;s in the process of recruiting \u003ca class=\"language\" href=\"https://elm-lang.org/\"\u003eElm\u003c/a\u003e\n developers. Once again, Tom\u0026rsquo;s response is resolute: \u0026ldquo;Absolutely not! Where could I possibly locate a pool of \u003ca class=\"language\" href=\"https://elm-lang.org/\"\u003eElm\u003c/a\u003e\n-savvy developers?

You see, for any given application, we require a team of 20 individuals to consistently handle maintenance and bug fixes. Where on earth would we come across 20 \u003ca class=\"language\" href=\"https://elm-lang.org/\"\u003eElm\u003c/a\u003e\n developers?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t \u003ca class=\"language\" href=\"https://elm-lang.org/\"\u003eElm\u003c/a\u003e\n apps theoretically require significantly less maintenance, given the multitude of bugs that are caught during the initial development stages?\u0026rdquo; Sarah counters silently within her mind. An idea begins to form, one she opts to keep to herself, \u0026ldquo;Ah, so maintaining a delicate codebase might indicate a higher demand for fresh \u003cabbr class=\"language\" title=\"JS\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/\"\u003eJavaScript\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/abbr\u003e\n developers - implying enhanced job security!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling rather clever, she decides to validate her hunch by perusing the (imaginary) yellow pages, named Glassdoor. And lo and behold, an endless scroll unveils a plethora of distinct job listings, all centered around \u003cabbr class=\"language\" title=\"JS\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/\"\u003eJavaScript\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/abbr\u003e\n.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, Sarah learns \u003cabbr class=\"language\" title=\"JS\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/\"\u003eJavaScript\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/abbr\u003e\n and all her beliefs gets validated, she becomes a very wealthy engineer, with a great job security, with each company she enters trying to keep her, year-after-yer, while other companies trying to persuade her by higher and higher offers. Or at least that was the boring version of this post that did not start with the word \u0026ldquo;tragedy\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, she uncovers that her counterparts, much like herself, had also been quite \u003cem\u003eclever\u003c/em\u003e. A multitude of newcomers gravitated towards the language flaunting the highest job listings. Each job opening faced a surplus of around a hundred contenders. The \u0026ldquo;victor,\u0026rdquo; so to speak, emerges as the individual boasting the most qualifications and the most modest salary expectation. Or should we even label them as victors, considering that the instant they dare to dream a little bigger, a fresh job listing crops up, promptly displacing them with the next eager contender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom, our trusty \n, worn out from the cycle of on-boarding one low-budget, novice developer after another, vents his frustrations to the \n. The \n engages in discussions with the investors, who share the same dissatisfaction due to their profits being eroded by an inefficient workforce. They call upon the \n to devise a remedy for this predicament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \n returns with a strategy to shift from \n to \u003ca class=\"language\" href=\"https://elm-lang.org/\"\u003eElm\u003c/a\u003e\n technology. The investors, content with the proposal, take a brief pause to deliberate. A few days later, they rejoin the conversation, expressing a notable apprehension. \u0026ldquo;\u003ca class=\"language\" href=\"https://elm-lang.org/\"\u003eElm\u003c/a\u003e\n is practically unheard of! None of our rivals employ this language.

Given the inherent high-stakes nature of startups, Arash adopts a prudent approach by examining the practices of more established corporations, such as those overseen by individuals like Tom in his role as \u003cabbr title=\"Chief Technology Officer\"\u003eCTO\u003c/abbr\u003e\n, in order to identify a tried-and-true trajectory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-lose-lose-lose-situation\"\u003eThe Lose-Lose-Lose situation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt every juncture, every individual optimized their decisions for personal gain. At each instance, a superior option was presented, and they acknowledged the benefits it offered. Nevertheless, they settled for the inferior alternative (for the sake of avoiding any unnecessary debate, let\u0026rsquo;s refrain from mentioning that the hypothetical lesser choice was \u003cabbr title=\"Sorry I have not defined this abbreviation. Can you please report this to me with my email?\"\u003eJavaScript\u003c/abbr\u003e\n, naturally). As a result, each person finds themselves in a less advantageous position than if they had collectively embraced the superior alternative. This impact ripples beyond individuals, extending to the entire ecosystem, hindered by the precarious edifice of abstractions left behind by the swiftly growing number of predecessors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, why did they all fall short of enhancing their own lives and the lives of others? Was it the technology\u0026rsquo;s flaw? Or did the ecosystem falter? You\u0026rsquo;re astute enough to deduce the answer; after all, you had the wit to discern the languages I implicitly referred to in my hypothetical scenarios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-solution\"\u003eThe Solution\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must admit, I\u0026rsquo;m uncertain. The nuclear arsenal continues to expand, even though the era of the Cold War has long passed. Thankfully, our world hasn\u0026rsquo;t been ravaged by nuclear conflict. Rather, it\u0026rsquo;s the interplay of mutually assured destruction and the realization by the leaders of those two nations that not embracing an alternative risk could lead to dire consequences. This, at least, has placed us in a relatively improved state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimultaneously, we find ourselves grappling with  \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Hardin\" class=\"person p-name\"\u003eGarrett Hardin\u003c/a\u003e     \n\u0026rsquo;s preoccupation \u0026ndash; the persistent challenges of overpopulation and looming environmental catastrophes. Evidently, the far-reaching peril of not embracing an alternative is of such extended duration that it transcends the immediate concerns of the very generation opting against alternatives. The burden of their choices is instead borne by their descendants: \u003cq cite=\"Current Generation\"\u003eFuck those brats.\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the world of software, the tempo is notably faster, the stakes less dire compared to earlier circumstances, and the individuals engaged are often more honest than politicians and notably smarter than the average voter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the remedy doesn\u0026rsquo;t entail adhering to an oddly precise series\nof ritualistic maneuvers. It\u0026rsquo;s a more daunting challenge. Just as\n \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Hardin\" class=\"person p-name\"\u003eGarrett Hardin\u003c/a\u003e     \n titled his article, the solution remains much the same:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe population problem has no technical solution; it requires a fundamental extension of in morality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"dear-reader\"\u003eDear Reader\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know!

A promising start, indeed, leaving many with pleasant experiences during the inception of Web 2.0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, alas, as time went by, the very incentives that drove these Social Media companies veered them off their intended course. They embarked on a divergent path, straying from their professed mission, and now, Web 2.0 primarily serves as a platform to amplify the voices of journalists and celebrities (the actual someones), propelling them towards greater fame and recognition (the actual some goals).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driving force behind these shifts? The ever-persistent quest for revenue from advertisers, pushing them to create content that captures maximum engagement. The more captivating, the more lucrative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegrettably, the landscape has birthed what I would call the \u0026ldquo;four horsemen of reactionary engagement\u0026rdquo;: the doomsday, super political reporter; the enraging, populist racist politician; the trolling, impulsive \u003cabbr title=\"Chief Executive Officer\"\u003eCEO\u003c/abbr\u003e\n; and the drama-driven, vacuous celebrity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a nutshell, it appears you\u0026rsquo;ve been played for a fool.

If that need is already being fulfilled through other means, what purpose does Twitter truly serve?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you find yourself fortunate enough to reside in a country with trustworthy official channels, and your well-being hinges on crucial information like hurricane alerts, rest assured that dedicated services cater specifically to such needs.

They cunningly weave a narrative of how your life is all thanks to them, that your friendships exist solely because of their benevolence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by their deceiving ways. They mangle your interactions, force-feeding you ads and utter nonsense, all while claiming it\u0026rsquo;s an act of love. And when their misdeeds come to light, they stage a grand spectacle of apologies and vows to change, only to strike back even harder later on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s time to break free from this toxic cycle. I know it\u0026rsquo;s daunting, and fear may grip your heart initially, but liberate yourself from their clutches. You will discover a life far better than you ever imagined. You deserve more than this relentless manipulation. Embrace the freedom that awaits, my dear friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-find-a-good-tool\"\u003eHow to find a good tool\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"step-one-find-the-low-hanging-fruits\"\u003eStep One: Find The Low Hanging Fruits\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou stand at the precipice of transformation, ready to change your life for the better. The first step is to identify the areas in your life that require attention. What needs are you seeking to fulfill? And upon which inadequate services are you currently relying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my case, I sought:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA steady flow of lightweight information.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDaily interactions with fellow enthusiasts akin to myself.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA means to uncover specific data.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA reliable way to send emails.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor too long, I depended on subpar sources to meet these needs. For the first two, I found myself reliant on Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, and Google News. As for the third and fourth requirements, I resorted to Google\u0026rsquo;s services. However, all of these platforms consistently fell short and inflicted undue stress upon me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"step-two-find-effective-replacements\"\u003eStep Two: Find Effective Replacements\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my earlier post I have mentioned that I already have replaced most of these services with better ones. But I have not mentioned what constitutes an effective solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003ca href=\"../web-experience-makeover\"\u003emy previous post\u003c/a\u003e, I alluded to having replaced many of these services with superior alternatives. However, I haven\u0026rsquo;t delved into what exactly makes a solution effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllow me to outline the criteria and guiding principles for an empowering tool:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt should not cause you any harm.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt should not lock you in.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt should not feel frugal.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, let me delve into the rationale behind these criteria:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"1-dot-it-should-not-cause-you-more-harm-than-good\"\u003e1. It should not cause you more harm than good\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a tool causes more harm than good, why persist in using it at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo safeguard your interests, ensure that the tool operates with transparency. Platforms that intentionally harm users are less inclined to be forthcoming about their inner workings. Opt for open-source and audited software, provided you trust the incentives and capabilities of the auditors, as this fosters transparency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, it is crucial to align the incentives of the tool\u0026rsquo;s creators with your own. While there will always be some degree of misalignment, not all cases are equal. Selling or renting software may incentivize developers to plan for obsolescence, sell incomplete products, or enforce lock-ins. Yet, these misalignments are overshadowed by the egregious discrepancies inherent in ad-driven models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"2-dot-it-should-not-lock-you-in\"\u003e2. It should not lock you in\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, the peril of being locked into a tool becomes evident when the company\u0026rsquo;s incentives undergo a shift. I experienced this firsthand in 2015 when I was a loyal Evernote user with a premium subscription, trusting it with all my valuable information. However, when Evernote decided to drop right-to-left language support crucial for the Middle Eastern languages, my pleas for assistance fell on deaf ears. They deemed the region unworthy of attention, leaving me stranded and unable to utilize my data effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe true pain emerged when I attempted to export my information and realized I was trapped in their ecosystem. They held my notes hostage, providing them back only in a non-standard format through XML or JSON files. This, my friends, was the dreaded lock-in, and I had to endure a labyrinthine journey of manual extraction to break free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo avoid such a predicament, one essential question should be posed:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill it be more difficult for me to switch to a competitor once I\u0026rsquo;ve fully adopted this service compared to my current situation before using it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the service retains your data and only offers it back in a non-standard format, it becomes significantly more challenging to transition to a competitor after investing your notes into the first service. Be vigilant and consider the implications before getting entangled in such situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"3-dot-it-should-not-feel-frugal-dot\"\u003e3. It should not feel frugal.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet us keep in mind the essence of this endeavor: to enhance the quality of our lives. Undoubtedly, there are noble causes that may necessitate adopting a certain level of frugality, as was the case for me with animal rights, which amusingly led me to embrace veganism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, advocating for these causes demands energy, and it might inadvertently lead to isolation. We must acknowledge that not everything can or should be a constant battle. The purpose of utilizing these tools is to improve our lives, not to make them more arduous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf safeguarding your privacy to the utmost extreme is your goal, then by all means, employ complex passwords for each site and commit them to memory. Nevertheless, we must be mindful that our fighting energy is finite. Thus, it becomes essential to prioritize and channel our limited energy toward the most urgent and meaningful issues that truly resonate with our hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"dear-reader\"\u003eDear Reader\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are on the right path, and I believe in you wholeheartedly! Trust me, I\u0026rsquo;ve been through this journey myself, and it turned out to be a delightful and straightforward experience. Take heart, for you can certainly achieve it too! Keep going, and you\u0026rsquo;ll soon realize how much better and easier life becomes. You\u0026rsquo;ve got this!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
