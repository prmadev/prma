      <description>Intro Ever since I have moved to the mastodon platform after the great twitter migration. I was curious about two main instances. One being Fosstodon, an instance oriented around FOSS, another being Hachyderm, an instance that introduces itself as social media for technical professionals.

In any system of governance the authority is constrained to the resources it has available. And for the authority to make a change, it has to answer to the resource providers. Given a set interdependent institutions one could form check-and-balance system.</description>
